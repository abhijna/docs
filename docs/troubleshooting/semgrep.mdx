## Semgrep exited with code -11 (or -9)[​](#semgrep-exited-with-code--11-or--9 "Direct link to Semgrep exited with code -11 (or -9)")

This can happen when Semgrep crashes, usually as a result of memory exhaustion. `-11` and `-9` are the POSIX signals raised to cause the crash.

Review troubleshooting steps for memory exhaustion at [Semgrep scan troubleshooting: Memory usage issues](/docs/kb/semgrep-code/semgrep-scan-troubleshooting#memory-usage-issues-oom-errors).

## Semgrep is too slow[​](#semgrep-is-too-slow "Direct link to Semgrep is too slow")

Semgrep records runtimes for each file and rule. This information is displayed when you include the `--time` flag when running Semgrep. How you choose to interact with the `--time` output depends on your goals.

### I want Semgrep to run faster[​](#i-want-semgrep-to-run-faster "Direct link to I want Semgrep to run faster")

Review troubleshooting steps for slow scans at [Semgrep scan troubleshooting: Slow scans](/docs/kb/semgrep-code/semgrep-scan-troubleshooting#slow-scans).
