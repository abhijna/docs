This document defines the language maturity levels used on the [Supported languages](/docs/supported-languages) page.

## Semgrep Code[​](#semgrep-code "Direct link to Semgrep Code")

Semgrep Code languages can be classified into four maturity levels:

* Generally available (GA)
* Beta
* Experimental
* Community supported\*

\*Community supported languages meet the parse rate and syntax requirements of **Experimental** languages. Users can still access community rules or write their own rules.

| **Feature**         | **GA**                                                                                           | **Beta**                                                                                      | **Experimental**                                                                                                      | **Community supported**                                                                                                                                  |
