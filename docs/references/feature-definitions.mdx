This document defines the terms used when discussing Semgrep analysis features in [Supported languages](/docs/supported-languages).

## Cross-file dataflow analysis[​](#cross-file-dataflow-analysis "Direct link to Cross-file dataflow analysis")

Cross-file analysis (also known as **interfile analysis**) takes into account how information flows between files. In particular, cross-file analysis includes **cross-file taint analysis**, which tracks unsanitized variables flowing from a source to a sink through arbitrarily many files. Other analyses performed across files include constant propagation and type inference.

Cross-file analysis is usually used in contrast to intrafile, or per-file analysis, where each file is analyzed as a standalone block of code.

Languages with cross-file support also include cross-function support.

## Cross-function dataflow analysis[​](#cross-function-dataflow-analysis "Direct link to Cross-function dataflow analysis")

Cross-function analysis means that interactions between functions are taken into account. This improves taint analysis, which tracks unsanitized variables flowing from a source to a sink through arbitrarily many functions.

## Reachability analysis[​](#reachability-analysis "Direct link to Reachability analysis")

Reachability refers to whether or not a vulnerable code pattern from a dependency is used in the codebase that imports it. In Semgrep Supply Chain, both a dependency's vulnerable version and code pattern must match for a vulnerability to be considered reachable.

See [Overview of Semgrep Supply Chain](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/overview) to learn how Semgrep leverages its code-scanning and rule syntax capabilities to provide high-signal rules that determine a finding's reachability. This assists security engineers in remediation and triage processes.
