This quickstart guide will help you set up Semgrep and scan your first project using Semgrep Managed Scans.

<Info>
  A **project** is any codebase, repository, or folder within a monorepo that is added to Semgrep for scanning. This includes all the findings, history, and scan metadata for the project.
</Info>

## What are Semgrep Managed Scans?[​](#what-are-semgrep-managed-scans "Direct link to What are Semgrep Managed Scans?")

Semgrep Managed Scans allow you to run Semgrep scans without needing to set up and maintain your own infrastructure. It provides a simple, scalable way to scan your code for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and other problems without setting up and maintaining separate configurations for each project.

## Supported source code managers[​](#supported-source-code-managers "Direct link to Supported source code managers")

You must be an existing [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/) user with one of the following plans:

* Bitbucket Cloud Premium plans or Bitbucket Data Center (v8.8 or above for diff-aware scans)
* Hosted GitHub (GitHub.com) and GitHub Enterprise Server plans
* GitLab Cloud and GitLab self-managed plans and a Premium or Ultimate subscription
* Azure DevOps Cloud repositories

## Add projects to Semgrep Managed Scans[​](#add-projects-to-semgrep-managed-scans "Direct link to Add projects to Semgrep Managed Scans")

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Azure DevOps">
    ### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bitbucket">
    You must have admin access to your Azure DevOps organization.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    Read access is granted through an access token you generate on Azure DevOps. You can provide this token by [adding Azure DevOps as a source code manager](/docs/deployment/connect-scm#connect-to-cloud-hosted-orgs).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitLab">
    Semgrep recommends setting up and configuring Semgrep with an Azure DevOps service account, not a personal account. Regardless of whether you use a personal or service account, the account must be assigned the **Owner** or **Project Collection Administrator** role for the organization. During setup and configuration, you must provide a personal access token generated by this account. This token must be authorized with **Full access**. Once you have Semgrep Managed Scans fully configured, you can update the token provided to Semgrep to a more restrictive one. The scopes you must assign to the token include:
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    * `Code: Read`
    * `Code: Status`
    * `Member Entitlement Management: Read`
    * `Project and Team: Read & write`
    * `Pull Request Threads: Read & write`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    ### Add a project[​](#add-a-project "Direct link to Add a project")
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login)
    2. Navigate to **Projects**, and click **Scan new project > Semgrep Managed Scan**.
    3. In the **Enable Managed Scans for repos** page, select the repositories you want to add to Semgrep Managed Scans.
    4. Click **Enable Managed Scans**. The **Enable Managed Scans** dialog appears. By default, Semgrep runs both full and diff-aware scans.
    5. Click **Enable**. You are taken to the **Projects** page as your scans begin.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    ### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites-1 "Direct link to Prerequisites")
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    You must have admin access to your GitHub organization.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    To enable and use this feature, you must grant Semgrep **Read access** to your code. This is done by installing a private GitHub app that you create and register yourself. The steps to do so are provided in the subsequent section of this document. See [Managed Scans > Security](/docs/deployment/managed-scanning/overview#security) for more information on how Semgrep handles your code once you've provided read access.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    ### Add a project[​](#add-a-project-1 "Direct link to Add a project")
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    1. Go to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login), and sign up by clicking on **Sign in with GitHub**. Follow the on-screen prompts to [grant Semgrep the necessary permissions](/docs/deployment/checklist#permissions) and proceed.
    2. Provide the **Organization display name** you'd like to use, then click **Create new organization**.
    3. When asked **Where do you want to scan?** click **GitHub**.
    4. Follow the steps in the **Connect GitHub to Semgrep** page. These steps install a public GitHub app to handle PR comments and a private GitHub app to handle code access. You can select which repositories these apps have access to, and remove or revoke their permissions at any time.
    5. Click **Set up projects**. You are taken to the **Enable Managed Scans for repos** page.
    6. Select all the repositories you want to add to Semgrep Managed Scans for scanning.
    7. Click **Enable Managed Scans**. You are taken to the **Projects** page as your scans begin.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    ### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites-2 "Direct link to Prerequisites")
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    Semgrep Managed Scanning (SMS) requires one of the following plans:
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    * GitLab Premium
    * GitLab Ultimate
    * GitLab Self Managed
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    You must provide a GitLab group access token or personal access token to Semgrep. The token must have the `api` scope assigned to it.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    During SMS onboarding, the group or user to which the token is assigned must have one of the following roles:
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    * `Maintainer`
    * `Owner`
    * `Admin`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    This is because managed scans of GitLab repositories require the enablement of webhooks to facilitate diff-aware scans and the creation of pull request comments by Semgrep. The webhooks are enabled by default when you set up Managed Scans and add GitLab as a source code manager. Once onboarding is complete, you can downgrade the role assigned to the token to `Developer`.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    ### Add a project[​](#add-a-project-2 "Direct link to Add a project")

Semgrep now performs a full scan on all the projects that you added in batches.

You can [view your projects in Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects/scanning). All projects with a Managed Scan configuration are tagged with `managed-scan`, regardless of whether they are actively being scanned by Semgrep Managed Scans.

## Next steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")

Once a scan has finished, you can view your findings on the following Semgrep AppSec Platform pages:

* [Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings?tab=open\&primary=true) for SAST findings
* [Secrets](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/secrets?tab=open\&validation_state=confirmed_valid,validation_error,no_validator) for secrets findings
* [Supply Chain](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/supply-chain/vulnerabilities?primary=true\&tab=open) for SCA findings

See [Semgrep Managed Scans](/docs/deployment/managed-scanning/overview) to learn more about how Semgrep manages your scans.
