Learn how to set up Semgrep, scan your first project, which can be any codebase, repository, or folder within a monorepo, for security issues, and view your findings.

<Info>
  You must have Python 3.10 or later installed on the machine where the Semgrep CLI is running.
</Info>

1. Go to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login), and sign up by clicking on **Continue with GitHub** or **Continue with GitLab**. Follow the on-screen prompts to grant Semgrep the necessary permissions.

2. Provide the **Organization display name** you'd like to use, then click **Create new organization**.

3. When asked **Where do you want to scan?** click **Run on CLI**.

4. Launch your CLI, and follow the instructions on the [**Scan a project on your machine**](https://semgrep.dev/onboarding/scan) page. For your convenience, the same information is presented below, along with instructions for Windows users.

   <Tabs>
     <Tab title="macOS">
       1. Install the Semgrep CLI and confirm the installation:

          ```
          # install through homebrewbrew install semgrep# install through pippython3 -m pip install semgrep# confirm installation succeeded by printing the currently installed versionsemgrep --version
          ```

          <Note>
            **Homebrew users:** ensure that you've [added Homebrew to your PATH](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#my-mac-apps-dont-find-homebrew-utilities).
          </Note>

       2. Log in to your Semgrep account. Running this command launches a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed:

          ```
          semgrep login
          ```

       3. In the **Semgrep CLI login**, click **Activate** to proceed.

       4. Return to the CLI, navigate to the root of your project, and run your first scan:

          ```
          semgrep ci
          ```
     </Tab>

     <Tab title="Linux">
       5. Install the Semgrep CLI and confirm the installation:

          ```
          # install through pippython3 -m pip install semgrep# if you get the following error "error: externally-managed-environment",# see semgrep.dev/docs/kb/semgrep-appsec-platform/error-externally-managed-environment # confirm installation succeeded by printing the currently installed versionsemgrep --version
          ```

       6. Log in to your Semgrep account. Running this command launches a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed:

          ```
          semgrep login
          ```

       7. In the **Semgrep CLI login**, click **Activate** to proceed.

       8. Return to the CLI, navigate to the root of your project, and run your first scan:

          ```
          semgrep ci
          ```
     </Tab>

     <Tab title="Windows (beta)">
       9. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python. Make sure to check the box to add python.exe to the PATH, otherwise you will have difficulty running Pip and Semgrep.

       10. Configure your system to run Python with UTF-8 text encodings by default. In PowerShell, run:

           ```
           [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYTHONUTF8', '1', 'User')
           ```

       11. Install the Semgrep CLI and confirm the installation. In PowerShell, run:

           ```
           # install through pippip install –upgrade semgrep# if you get the following error "error: externally-managed-environment",# see semgrep.dev/docs/kb/semgrep-appsec-platform/error-externally-managed-environment # confirm installation succeeded by printing the currently installed versionsemgrep --version
           ```

       12. Log in to your Semgrep account. Running this command launches a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed:

           ```
           semgrep login
           ```

       13. In the **Semgrep CLI login**, click **Activate** to proceed.

       14. Return to the CLI, navigate to the root of your project, and run your first scan:

           ```
           semgrep ci
           ```
     </Tab>

     <Tab title="Docker">
       <Info>
         Ensure that you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) before proceeding.
       </Info>
     </Tab>

     <Tab title>
       15. Pull the latest image and confirm the version:

           ```
           docker pull semgrep/semgrep# confirm versiondocker run --rm semgrep/semgrep semgrep --version
           ```

       16. For users running Docker on **macOS or Linux** Docker:

           1. Log in to your Semgrep account (running this command will launch a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed):

              ```
              docker run -it semgrep/semgrep semgrep login
              ```

           2. In the **Semgrep CLI login**, click **Activate** to proceed. Return to the CLI and copy the login token that's shown.

           3. Navigate into the root of your project, and run your first scan. Be sure to substitute `YOUR_TOKEN` with the login token value you copied in the previous step:

              ```
              docker run -e SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" semgrep/semgrep semgrep ci
              ```

              The provided `-v` option mounts the current directory into the container to be scanned. Navigate into a different project or provide a specific local directory in the command to scan a different project.

       17. For users running Docker on **Windows**:

           1. Log in to your Semgrep account (running this command will launch a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed):

              ```
              docker run -it semgrep/semgrep semgrep login
              ```

           2. In the **Semgrep CLI login**, click **Activate** to proceed. Return to the CLI, and copy the login token that's shown.

           3. Navigate into the root of your project, and run your first scan. Be sure to substitute `YOUR_TOKEN` with the login token value you copied in the previous step:

              ```
              docker run -e SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN --rm -v "%cd%:/src" semgrep/semgrep semgrep ci
              ```

              The provided `-v` option mounts the current directory into the container to be scanned. Navigate into a different project or provide a specific local directory in the command to scan a different project.
     </Tab>

5. Once you've scanned your first application, return to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/) to see the security vulnerabilities in your project. For detailed information, click **Code** to access your SAST findings or **Supply Chain** to access your SCA findings.

   <Info>
     **Code is not uploaded.** Only **findings** are sent to Semgrep AppSec Platform.

## Scan without a GitHub or GitLab account[​](#scan-without-a-github-or-gitlab-account "Direct link to Scan without a GitHub or GitLab account")

If you don't have a GitHub or GitLab account, you can use `semgrep scan` in your CLI. See [Scan your project](/docs/getting-started/cli#scan-your-project) for more details.
