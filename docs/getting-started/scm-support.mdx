**†**&#x53;emgrep Assistant and Managed Scans require a workspace access token, which is only available to users with Bitbucket Cloud Premium.

**\***&#x53;emgrep Managed Scans requires access to group webhooks, which is unavailable to GitLab Free users.

## Access limitations[​](#access-limitations "Direct link to Access limitations")

You may need to add [Semgrep's IP addresses](/docs/deployment/checklist#ip-addresses) to your ingress and egress allowlists, or you can use the [Network Broker](/docs/semgrep-ci/network-broker), if any of the following conditions apply:

* Your SCM offers security features that limit access to your resources
* Your SCM is behind a firewall or protected by network restrictions regarding access
* You are using a virtual private network (VPN)
