### January 2026 release notes summary

* Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Findings** page displays more descriptive rule group names, and the **Finding Details** page displays more descriptive rule names. For example, `sequelize-express` is now `SQL injection in Sequelize with Express`.

* **CLI**:

  * Improved the performance of scan planning by reducing the cost of re-hashing `Target` objects. Semgrep's performance improvement on scans of large projects is proportional to the number of files in the project.
  * In `--debug` mode, Semgrep warns you if you attempt to run a parallel scan with a larger value for `-j`/`--jobs` than the number of CPUs Semgrep has detected as available for use.
  * Semgrep now provides a suggested starting value for `-j`/`--jobs`.
  * `semgrep login` now supports the use of `--force`, which ignores existing tokens and starts a new login session.

* Supply Chain's reachability analysis now covers all **critical** and **high** severity CVEs from supported sources starting in 2017 across **all** supported languages.

* Supply Chain now supports Gradle lockfiles of the form `gradle*.lockfile`. Previously, only files with the exact name `gradle.lockfile` were supported.

* Supply Chain's dependency search now allows you to search for one or more packages using:

  * The name of the package
  * An exact version number
  * A range of version numbers

* Members can now create suggested memories for Assistant when triaging findings in Semgrep AppSec Platform. Previously, only admins could do so.
