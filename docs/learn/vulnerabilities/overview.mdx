title: "Understanding Security Vulnerabilities"
---




An **application security vulnerability** is a weaknesses in software systems that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of applications and data. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for building secure applications and maintaining a strong security posture.

## What We'll Teach You[​](#what-well-teach-you "Direct link to What We'll Teach You")

This section covers common security vulnerabilities that affect modern applications. For each vulnerability type, we'll explain:

* **How the vulnerability occurs** including the root causes and common scenarios.
* **Real-world examples** with code patterns that introduce these types of issues.
* **Impact and risks** as a consequence for when these vulnerabilities are exploited.
* **Prevention techniques** and secure coding best practices to avoid the problems.
* **Detection methods** such as how Semgrep can help with identification by scanning code.

Learning about these vulnerabilities helps you write more secure code and build better defenses into your applications from the start.

## Vulnerability Categories[​](#vulnerability-categories "Direct link to Vulnerability Categories")

We cover many types of vulnerabilities, organized by their impact and attack vectors. Browse the vulnerability-specific guides:

* **[Code Injection (RCE)](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/code-injection)**
* **[Command Injection](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/command-injection)**
* **[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/cross-site-scripting)**
* **[Insecure Deserialization](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/insecure-deserialization)**
* **[Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/idor)**
* **[Open Redirect](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/open-redirect)**
* **[Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/server-side-request-forgery)**
* **[SQL Injection (SQLi)](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/sql-injection)**
* **[XML Security (XEE, XXE)](/docs/learn/vulnerabilities/xml-security)**

Each category includes detailed explanations, common attack scenarios, prevention techniques, and discusses Semgrep rules to help identify these issues in your code.
