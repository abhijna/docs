You can receive emails from Semgrep regarding **new findings** and **failed scans**.

Perform these steps in Semgrep AppSec Platform to create an email integration and receive notifications:

1. Create an email integration:

   1. On the navigation menu, click **Settings > Integrations > Add**.
   2. Click on **Email**.
   3. Enter a **Name** for the integration.
   4. Enter the **Email** address to receive Semgrep findings.
   5. Click **Subscribe**.

2. Turn notifications on:

   1. Click **Rules > Policies > Rule Modes**.
   2. Click the **Edit** button of the Rule Mode for which you want to receive email notifications. For example, if you want to be notified of all blocking findings through email, click the **Edit** button of the **Block** mode.
   3. Repeat the previous step for all Rule Modes that you want to receive notifications for.

## Notification and alert de-duplication[​](#notification-and-alert-de-duplication "Direct link to Notification and alert de-duplication")

Notifications are sent only the first time a given finding is detected.

When running a diff-aware scan, Semgrep doesn't notify you when a pull request has a finding that existed on the base branch already, even if that line is moved or re-indented.

Semgrep also tracks notifications that have already been sent, so subsequent scans of the same changes in a pull request won't result in duplicate notifications.

<Note>
  See [Findings in CI](/docs/semgrep-ci/findings-ci) for more information about how Semgrep tracks a finding through its lifetime.
</Note>

### Number of emails[​](#number-of-emails "Direct link to Number of emails")

Emails about new findings are triggered only once. These emails also include a **summary** of current open findings.
