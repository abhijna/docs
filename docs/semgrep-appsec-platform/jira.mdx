title: "Create Jira tickets"
---

* [Beta](/docs/tags/beta)
* [Semgrep AppSec Platform](/docs/tags/semgrep-app-sec-platform)


The Semgrep Jira integration allows you to create Jira tickets based on your Semgrep Code, Supply Chain, and Secrets findings.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* You must have a **Jira Cloud** plan. Jira Data Center (self-managed or on-premise) is not supported.
* You must have at least one Jira project to set as the default location where tickets will be created.
* Optional, but recommended: A [service account](https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/understand-service-accounts/) to set up and configure the Jira integration.

## Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

The Semgrep Jira integration provides the following capabilities:

* You can create tickets for findings from Semgrep Code, Supply Chain, and Secrets.
* You can create a single ticket for multiple findings (up to 75) that were detected by a single rule in the same project, or create individual tickets per finding.
* You can automate the creation of tickets for critical or high severity findings. See [Automatic creation of tickets](#automatic-creation-of-tickets) for more details.
* Tickets can be created in **multiple Jira projects** if manually specified at ticket creation time.

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

* You can only create **one Jira integration** per Semgrep account or deployment.
* You can only use **one subdomain** per Jira integration.
* The Semgrep Jira integration does not support bi-directional or two-way status syncing.

## Enable the Jira integration[​](#enable-the-jira-integration "Direct link to Enable the Jira integration")

To enable the Jira integration, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Navigate to [**Settings** > **Integrations**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/integrations).
3. Click **Add**. In the menu that appears, select **Jira**.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant Semgrep the necessary permissions and set up the integration.
5. When prompted, select the Jira instance you want to connect to. If you have multiple Jira instances, choose one instance from the **Use app on** drop-down menu.
   * **For deployments that have used a previous version of the Jira integration**: Ensure you're connecting to the same Jira instance you previously connected to. Please contact Semgrep if you want to connect to a different Jira instance.

## Configure the integration[​](#configure-the-integration "Direct link to Configure the integration")

Once you have enabled the Jira integration, you must complete the following steps on Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Integrations** page:

1. Select the **Subdomain** for the Jira instance you want to use.
2. Select the **Default project** where the Jira tickets will be created.
3. Select the **Issue type** you want created with your Semgrep findings.
4. Optional: To see an example of the content Semgrep populates your Jira ticket with, click **See preview**.
5. Optional: Click **Customize ticket creation**, then select the product whose tickets you want to customize. Automated ticket creation is configured on a per-product basis. For each **Jira field** available on the Jira ticket, you can map to it a **Semgrep or static field** value. See [Create mappings](#create-mappings) for more information.
6. Click **Save changes** to proceed.

### Automatic creation of tickets[​](#automatic-creation-of-tickets "Direct link to Automatic creation of tickets")

All products limit automatic ticket creation to **Critical** or **High** severity findings. Code findings must also be on your [primary branch](/docs/deployment/primary-branch).

* For Code, Semgrep automatically creates tickets for **high confidence findings**.
* For Supply Chain, Semgrep automatically creates tickets for **reachable findings** on the primary branch and **malicious dependency findings** on **any** branch.
* For Secrets, Semgrep automatically creates tickets for **validated secrets** on **any** branch.

Tickets are automatically created for new findings after each scan completes. These tickets always group findings by rule when a scan identifies multiple new findings for the same rule. Automatic ticket creation does not change the triage state of related findings, since related findings have not yet been reviewed by a human when the ticket is generated.

### Automatic detection of other Jira projects[​](#automatic-detection-of-other-jira-projects "Direct link to Automatic detection of other Jira projects")

The Jira integration automatically detects other Jira projects in your subdomain under the following conditions:

* The projects and Issue types are **company-managed**, not team-managed. See the Jira documentation about [Team-managed and company-managed projects](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-are-team-managed-and-company-managed-projects/)
* Those projects have the same **Issue type** as the default project. [When you triage a finding](#code), you can choose which project to create the tickets in.

<Warning>
  Issue types may have the same name but different Issue type IDs. When creating tickets, only company-managed Jira projects whose issue type ID matches the default project selected in the integration will appear in the list of available projects. If you don't see other Jira projects when creating tickets, check that the Issue type ID is the same across Jira projects. See the [Finding the Issue Type ID in Jira Cloud](https://support.atlassian.com/jira/kb/finding-the-issue-type-id-in-jira-cloud/) for details.
</Warning>

### Create mappings[​](#create-mappings "Direct link to Create mappings")

Optionally, you can customize the Jira field mappings and indicate which values they should be populated with. Semgrep can map either Semgrep fields or static data to Jira fields.

Semgrep automatically populates the Jira **Reporter**, **Summary**, and **Description** fields. The issue **Reporter** is the integration user, and the **Summary** and **Description** contain information about the vulnerability. Click **See preview** to review the default mappings and any custom mappings you have created.

Currently, Semgrep supports the mapping of the following field types:

* Short texts
* Paragraphs
* Drop-down menus
* Checkboxes
* Labels
* Components (including Compass components)

The integration supports the use of custom Jira issue types and custom fields. However, it does not support field types other than those listed above. If you have a required field of a different type in your project, it will not be possible for Semgrep to map a value to that field, and issue creation will fail.

To create a field mapping:

1. Select the Semgrep product for which the mapping is valid: **Code**, **Supply Chain**, or **Secrets**.
2. Click **Add mapping**.
3. Select the **Jira field** to which the Semgrep data should be mapped. You can [create a new field](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/create-a-custom-field/) if necessary. If you opt not to add Semgrep values to your Jira fields, you can create an [automation to map to your field values](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/automation/overview#what-is-automation).
4. Select the **Semgrep field** that holds the data to be mapped.

Repeat these steps for each mapping you want to create. When done, click **Save changes** to proceed.

<Warning>
  Ensure a 1:1 mapping between the Jira issue type field values and the Semgrep values.
</Warning>

#### Available field mappings[​](#available-field-mappings "Direct link to Available field mappings")

<Accordion title="Click to see the list of Semgrep fields available for mapping to Jira ticket fields.">
  The following Semgrep fields are available to map to Jira fields for **all** products:

  * Any static value of your choice
  * Project name
  * Project tags
  * Finding timestamp
  * Commit URL
  * Rule name
  * Severity
  * Language
  * Rule description
  * Semgrep AppSec Platform link to the finding
  * Type (for example, Code, Secrets, Supply Chain)
  * Repository name
  * Team name
  * Components

  The following Semgrep fields are available to map to Jira fields for Semgrep Code findings:

  * Assistant triage
  * Assistant component
  * Rule confidence

  The following Semgrep fields are available to map to Jira fields for Semgrep Supply Chain findings:

  * Reachability
  * Transitivity
  * CVE
  * EPSS probability
  * Malicious Dependency

  The following Semgrep fields are available to map to Jira fields for Semgrep Secrets findings:

  * Validation
  * Project visibility
</Accordion>

#### Multiple labels[​](#multiple-labels "Direct link to Multiple labels")

You can map multiple labels to a single Semgrep field when creating a field mapping. In the **Add mapping** dialog:

1. Select **Labels** under **Jira fields**.
2. Select **Set a static value** under **Semgrep fields**. A text box appears.
3. Enter each label, separated by a comma. Each of these labels is then added to the ticket.

<Check>
  The **Project tag** Semgrep field also creates multiple labels.
</Check>

### Example mapping[​](#example-mapping "Direct link to Example mapping")

Semgrep's **Severity** field can have the following values: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, and `Critical`. The following Jira field setups can be used to capture this information:

* A short text issue type field
* A paragraph issue type field
* A drop-down issue type field with the following options: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`
* A checkbox issue type field with the following options: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Critical`

If you opt for a drop-down or a checkbox issue type field, verify that:

* There are no misspellings.
* No valid options are missing. If your drop-down or checkbox issue type is missing the `Medium` option, Jira cannot create tickets for medium-severity findings.

## Create tickets[​](#create-tickets "Direct link to Create tickets")

After setting up your Jira integration, you're now ready to create Jira tickets. Jira tickets can be created from findings in Semgrep Code, Supply Chain, and Secrets. Jira tickets cannot be created for [findings with a status of **Fixed**](/docs/semgrep-code/triage-remediation#triage-statuses) or [removed findings](/docs/semgrep-code/triage-remediation#removed-findings), since those findings no longer require action to address.

### Component Mappings[​](#component-mappings "Direct link to Component Mappings")

If you've created a custom field mapping for a component field type, be aware that if you choose to create tickets in a Jira project other than your default Jira project as configured in your integration settings, you must ensure that project has a component available with the same name as the component you selected for your mapping.

If your default project uses [**Jira components**](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-are-jira-components/) and you create a component field mapping in your integration settings, you can create tickets in another project **only if you have a Jira component with the same name in that project**.

If your default project uses [**Compass components**](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-are-compass-components/) and you create a component field mapping in your integration settings, you can create tickets in another project **only if your selected Compass component is available in that project**. You can configure which components are available in each project in your Compass settings.

### Code[​](#code "Direct link to Code")

You can create tickets for Code findings using the **Triage** button on the:

* [**Findings**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings) page
* Individual finding's **Details** page

To create tickets:

1. If you're on the [**Findings**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings) page, select the findings for which you want tickets created; you can select and create tickets for individual findings or all findings for a given rule. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.

2. Click **Triage**.

3. Set the status to **Open**, **Fixing**, or **Reviewing**. Select **Fixing** if it is a known issue that needs to be fixed or **Reviewing** if the finding needs more investigation.

4. Select the **Create tickets...** checkbox.

   1. Optional: Click the first drop-down list to choose between making a ticket for **groups of findings** or an individual ticket for **each finding**.
   2. Optional: Click the **Jira project** drop-down list to select which Jira project to add the findings to. You can choose any project that is associated with the issue type configured in your integration settings.

5. Optional: You can add **Comments** in the text box.

6. Click **Submit** to proceed.

<Info>
  * Creating tickets for many findings at once may take some time. Tickets that take longer than 10 seconds to create are shown in Semgrep once you refresh the page.
  * If ticket creation **fails**, Semgrep automatically retries several times over the next day to provide robustness against outages and downtime in third-party services.
</Info>

Once a ticket has been created, a link appears on the **Findings** page and in the sidebar of an individual finding's details page.

### Supply Chain[​](#supply-chain "Direct link to Supply Chain")

You can create tickets for Supply Chain findings using the **Triage** button on the:

* [**Supply Chain > Vulnerabilities**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/supply-chain/vulnerabilities) page
* Individual finding's **Details** page

To create tickets:

1. If you're on the [**Supply Chain > Vulnerabilities**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/supply-chain/vulnerabilities) page, select the findings for which you want tickets created. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.

2. Click **Triage**.

3. Set the status to **Open**, **Fixing**, or **Reviewing**. Select **Fixing** if it is a known issue that needs to be fixed or **Reviewing** if the finding needs more investigation.

4. Select the **Create tickets...** checkbox.

   1. Optional: Click the first drop-down list to choose between making a ticket for **groups of findings** or an individual ticket for **each finding**.
   2. Optional: Click the **Jira project** drop-down list to select which Jira project to add the findings to.

1. If you're on the [**Secrets**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/secrets) page, select the findings for which you want tickets created; you can select and create tickets for individual findings or all findings for a given rule. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.

2. Click **Triage**.

3. Set the status to **Open**, **Fixing**, or **Reviewing**. Select **Fixing** if it is a known issue that needs to be fixed or **Reviewing** if the finding needs more investigation.

4. Select the **Create tickets...** checkbox.

   1. Optional: Click the first drop-down list to choose between making a ticket for **groups of findings** or an individual ticket for **each finding**.
   2. Optional: Click the **Jira project** drop-down list to select which Jira project to add the findings to. You can choose any project that is associated with the issue type configured in your integration settings.

5. Optional: You can add **Comments** in the text box.

6. Click **Submit** to proceed.

## Create tickets through the Semgrep API[​](#create-tickets-through-the-semgrep-api "Direct link to Create tickets through the Semgrep API")

Semgrep provides an API endpoint you can use to create Jira tickets, either by passing a list of `issue_ids` or filter query parameters to select findings. Refer to the [Jira endpoint documentation](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/TicketingService).

## Ticket creation information[​](#ticket-creation-information "Direct link to Ticket creation information")

You can see a Jira ticket's creation information using the relevant finding's details page. The **Activity** section of the finding details page displays information about the successful ticket creation attempt, including the ticket ID:
