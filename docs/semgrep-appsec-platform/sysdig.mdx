The Semgrep Sysdig integration can ingest runtime context from your Sysdig account into Semgrep AppSec Platform. This allows you to prioritize findings based on deployment status.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before proceeding, ensure that:

* You have a license for **Semgrep Supply Chain**

* You have the following tools and integrations set up in your Sysdig account:

  * [Sysdig Secure](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/)
  * [Sysdig Shield](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/sysdig-secure/install-shield-kubernetes/), [Host Shield](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/sysdig-secure/install-host-shield/), or [Agentless Scanning](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/sysdig-secure/scanning-usecases/#agentless-host-scanning-tech-preview)
  * The [Semgrep Sysdig integration](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/integrations-for-sysdig-secure/software-composition-analysis/#semgrep)
    * Ensure that you've [completed the steps to link source to runtime by adding a Docker label](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/integrations-for-sysdig-secure/software-composition-analysis/#prerequisite-linking-source-to-runtime)

* You have set up a connection between [Semgrep and your source code manager (SCM)](/docs/deployment/connect-scm).

## Enable the Sysdig integration[​](#enable-the-sysdig-integration "Direct link to Enable the Sysdig integration")

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).

2. Navigate to [**Settings** > **Integrations**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/integrations).

3. Go to **Integrations**, and click **+ Add > Sysdig**.

4. In the dialog that appears, provide the following information:

   1. **URL**: The Sysdig Platform URL for your account.
   2. **API token**: The Sysdig API token associated with your account. See [Retrieve the Sysdig API Token](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/administration/retrieve-the-sysdig-api-token/) for more information on how to retrieve your token.

5. Click **Connect**.

6. Within several hours, you should see the **Deployment** status for each project on the project's settings page.

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

* Each Semgrep deployment can only have **one Sysdig integration**.

* The runtime context data is only synced for Semgrep projects that:

  * Are connected to SCMs
  * Have been scanned within the previous 30 days
  * Have Supply Chain findings

* The integration syncs your data every 24 hours, but it may take up to 1 day for Semgrep to reflect any changes to your repositories and infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

### If you see a **Connection Error** message under your Sysdig integration[​](#if-you-see-a-connection-error-message-under-your-sysdig-integration "Direct link to if-you-see-a-connection-error-message-under-your-sysdig-integration")

If you see the **Connection Error** message under your Sysdig integration, there was an issue establishing a connection or running a sync job for a provider you have connected. Check your connection settings to verify that your configuration is correct.

If the connection settings are correct, [contact Support](/docs/support) for further assistance.

### If you're not seeing data in your project settings page[​](#if-youre-not-seeing-data-in-your-project-settings-page "Direct link to If you're not seeing data in your project settings page")

If you're not seeing data for your project in the project settings page:

* Wait for one day for your data to sync.
* Confirm that an image of the project has been deployed in your infrastructure that Sysdig has access to
* If, after one day, you're still not seeing data, ensure that you meet the integration's prerequisites.
* If, after one day, you meet the integration's prerequisites and confirmed deployment, [contact Support](/docs/support) for further assistance.
