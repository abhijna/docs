<Check>
  Semgrep’s Kotlin coverage leverages framework-specific analysis capabilities that are not present in Semgrep Community Edition (CE). As a result, many framework specific Pro rules will **fail** to return findings if run on Semgrep CE. To ensure full security coverage, run: `semgrep login && semgrep ci`.

* Interfile analysis (cross-file)
* Interprocedural analysis (cross-function)
* All analyses performed by [Semgrep Community Edition (CE)](#kotlin-support-in-semgrep-ce)

## Coverage[​](#coverage "Direct link to Coverage")

Semgrep aims to provide comprehensive and accurate detection of common OWASP Top 10 issues in source code. Semgrep uses **rules**, which are instructions based on which it detects patterns in code. These rules are usually organized in rulesets.

By default, Semgrep Code provides you with the [`p/comment`](https://semgrep.dev/p/comment) and [`p/default`](https://semgrep.dev/p/default) rulesets. These rulesets provide the most accurate and comprehensive coverage across Semgrep's supported languages.

The following is an example of a Kotlin rule:

* [CWE-327: Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. NullCipher does not encrypt anything; avoid](https://semgrep.dev/playground/r/kotlin.lang.security.no-null-cipher.no-null-cipher?editorMode=advanced)

Many, but not all Kotlin rules require a Semgrep account. Sign in to Semgrep AppSec Platform to view this rule:

* [CWE-776: XML entity expansion. Securely configure your XML parser](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/editor/r/kotlin.xxe.xmlreader-xxe.xmlreader-xxe?editorMode=advanced)

## Kotlin support in Semgrep Supply Chain[​](#kotlin-support-in-semgrep-supply-chain "Direct link to Kotlin support in Semgrep Supply Chain")

Semgrep Supply Chain is a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your codebase introduced by open source dependencies.

<Check>
  Kotlin projects can be scanned **without** the need for lockfiles. See [Scan a project without lockfiles (beta)](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/getting-started#scan-a-project-without-lockfiles-beta).
</Check>

### Supported package managers[​](#supported-package-managers "Direct link to Supported package managers")

Semgrep supports the following Kotlin package managers:

* Gradle
* Maven

### Analyses and features[​](#analyses-and-features "Direct link to Analyses and features")

The following analyses and features are available for Kotlin:

* Reachability analysis

  Reachability refers to whether or not a vulnerable code pattern from a dependency is used in the codebase that imports it. In Semgrep Supply Chain, both a dependency's vulnerable version and code pattern must match for a vulnerability to be considered reachable.

* License detection

  Semgrep Supply Chain's **license compliance** feature enables you to explicitly allow or disallow (block) a package's use in your repository based on its license. For example, your company policy may disallow the use of packages with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC) license.

* SBOM generation

  Semgrep enables you to generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) to assess your third-party dependencies and comply with auditing procedures. Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC) can generate an SBOM for each repository you have added to Semgrep AppSec Platform.

## Kotlin support in Semgrep CE[​](#kotlin-support-in-semgrep-ce "Direct link to Kotlin support in Semgrep CE")

Semgrep CE is a fast, lightweight program analysis tool that can help you detect bugs in your code. It makes use of Semgrep's LGPL 2.1 open source engine.

### Analyses[​](#analyses "Direct link to Analyses")

* Single-file, cross-function constant propagation
* Single-function taint analysis
* Semantic analysis

### Coverage[​](#coverage "Direct link to Coverage")

<Check>
  * Check the `license` of a rule to ensure it meets your licensing requirements. See [Licensing](/docs/licensing) for more details.
</Check>

The Semgrep Registry provides the following Kotlin rule sets (many rules require a Semgrep account):

* [`p/default`](https://semgrep.dev/p/default)
* [`p/kotlin`](https://semgrep.dev/p/kotlin)

Sample usage:

```
semgrep scan --config p/kotlin
```
