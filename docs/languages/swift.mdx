<Check>
  Semgrep’s Swift coverage leverages framework-specific analysis capabilities that are not present in Semgrep Community Edition (CE). As a result, many framework specific Pro rules will **fail** to return findings if run on Semgrep CE. To ensure full security coverage, run: `semgrep login && semgrep ci`.

## Coverage[​](#coverage "Direct link to Coverage")

Semgrep aims to provide comprehensive and accurate detection of common OWASP Top 10 issues in source code. Semgrep uses **rules**, which are instructions based on which it detects patterns in code. These rules are usually organized in rulesets.

By default, Semgrep Code provides you with the [`p/comment`](https://semgrep.dev/p/comment) and [`p/default`](https://semgrep.dev/p/default) rulesets. These rulesets provide the most accurate and comprehensive coverage across Semgrep's supported languages.

Some examples of rules include:

* [CWE-477: Use of obsolete function. `ptrace` API is forbidden from iOS applications](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/editor/r/swift.lang.forbidden.forbidden-ios-api.swift-forbidden-ios-apis?editorMode=advanced)
* [CWE-327: Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. Avoid MD2](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/editor/r/swift.commoncrypto.insecure-hashing-algorithm-md2.insecure-hashing-algorithm-md2?editorMode=advanced)

To view these rules, sign in to Semgrep AppSec Platform.

## Swift support in Semgrep Supply Chain[​](#swift-support-in-semgrep-supply-chain "Direct link to Swift support in Semgrep Supply Chain")

Semgrep Supply Chain is a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your codebase introduced by open source dependencies.

### Supported package managers[​](#supported-package-managers "Direct link to Supported package managers")

Semgrep supports the following Swift package manager:

* SwiftPM

### Analyses and features[​](#analyses-and-features "Direct link to Analyses and features")

The following analyses and features are available for Swift:

* Reachability analysis

  Reachability refers to whether or not a vulnerable code pattern from a dependency is used in the codebase that imports it. In Semgrep Supply Chain, both a dependency's vulnerable version and code pattern must match for a vulnerability to be considered reachable.

* License detection

  Semgrep Supply Chain's **license compliance** feature enables you to explicitly allow or disallow (block) a package's use in your repository based on its license. For example, your company policy may disallow the use of packages with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC) license.

* SBOM generation

  Semgrep enables you to generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) to assess your third-party dependencies and comply with auditing procedures. Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC) can generate an SBOM for each repository you have added to Semgrep AppSec Platform.
