  Semgrep’s Python coverage leverages framework-specific analysis capabilities that are not present in Semgrep Community Edition (CE). As a result, many framework specific Pro rules will **fail** to return findings if run on Semgrep CE. To ensure full security coverage, run: `semgrep login && semgrep ci`.

## Python support in Semgrep Code[​](#python-support-in-semgrep-code "Direct link to Python support in Semgrep Code")

Semgrep Code is a static application security testing (SAST) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your first-party code.

### Analyses and frameworks[​](#analyses-and-frameworks "Direct link to Analyses and frameworks")

* Framework-specific control flow analysis
* Interfile analysis (cross-file)
* Interprocedural analysis (cross-function)
* All analyses performed by [Semgrep Community Edition (CE)](#python-support-in-semgrep-ce)

## Coverage[​](#coverage "Direct link to Coverage")

Semgrep aims to provide comprehensive and accurate detection of common OWASP Top 10 issues in source code. Semgrep uses **rules**, which are instructions based on which it detects patterns in code. These rules are usually organized in rulesets.

By default, Semgrep Code provides you with the [`p/comment`](https://semgrep.dev/p/comment) and [`p/default`](https://semgrep.dev/p/default) rulesets. These rulesets provide the most accurate and comprehensive coverage across Semgrep's supported languages.

In addition to rules, the Semgrep engine itself can analyze code and implicit dataflows in the context of the following supported frameworks:

| **Framework / library** | **Category**  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Django                  | Web framework |
| Flask                   | Web framework |
| FastAPI                 | Web framework |

### Benchmark results exclusive of [AI](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-assistant/overview) processing[​](#benchmark-results-exclusive-of-ai-processing "Direct link to benchmark-results-exclusive-of-ai-processing")

Semgrep's benchmarking process involves scanning open source repositories, triaging the findings, and making iterative rule updates. This process was developed and is used internally by the Semgrep security research team to monitor and improve rule performance.

Results as of **September 9, 2024**:

|                                                                        |                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Benchmark true positive rate (before AI processing) for latest ruleset | **84%**          |
| Lines of code scanned                                                  | **\~20 million** |

## Python support in Semgrep Supply Chain[​](#python-support-in-semgrep-supply-chain "Direct link to Python support in Semgrep Supply Chain")

Semgrep Supply Chain is a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that detects security vulnerabilities in your codebase introduced by open source dependencies.

<Check>
  Some Python projects can be scanned **without** the need for lockfiles. See [Scan a project without lockfiles (beta)](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/getting-started#scan-a-project-without-lockfiles-beta).
</Check>

### Supported package managers[​](#supported-package-managers "Direct link to Supported package managers")

Semgrep supports the following Python package managers:

* pip
* pip-tools
* Pipenv
* Poetry
* uv

### Analyses and features[​](#analyses-and-features "Direct link to Analyses and features")

The following analyses and features are available for Python:

* Reachability analysis

  Reachability refers to whether or not a vulnerable code pattern from a dependency is used in the codebase that imports it. In Semgrep Supply Chain, both a dependency's vulnerable version and code pattern must match for a vulnerability to be considered reachable.

* License detection

  Semgrep Supply Chain's **license compliance** feature enables you to explicitly allow or disallow (block) a package's use in your repository based on its license. For example, your company policy may disallow the use of packages with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC) license. Semgrep can help enforce this restriction.

* Malicious dependency detection

  Semgrep is able to detect malicious dependencies in your projects and in pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs).

* SBOM generation

  Semgrep enables you to generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) to assess your third-party dependencies and comply with auditing procedures. Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC) can generate an SBOM for each repository you have added to Semgrep AppSec Platform.

## Python support in Semgrep CE[​](#python-support-in-semgrep-ce "Direct link to Python support in Semgrep CE")

Semgrep CE is a fast, lightweight program analysis tool that can help you detect bugs in your code. It makes use of Semgrep's LGPL 2.1 open source engine.

### Analyses[​](#analyses "Direct link to Analyses")

* Single-file, cross-function constant propagation
* Single-function taint analysis
* Semantic analysis

### Coverage[​](#coverage "Direct link to Coverage")

<Check>
  * Check the `license` of a rule to ensure it meets your licensing requirements. See [Licensing](/docs/licensing) for more details.
</Check>

The Semgrep Registry provides the following JavaScript rulesets:

* [`p/default`](https://semgrep.dev/p/default)
* [`p/python`](https://semgrep.dev/p/python)
* [`p/trailofbits`](https://semgrep.dev/p/trailofbits)
* [`p/xss`](https://semgrep.dev/p/trailofbits)

Sample usage:

```
semgrep scan --config p/python
```
