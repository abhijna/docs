Semgrep's open source [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server scans AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities using Semgrep Code, Supply Chain, and Secrets. The IDE re-generates code until Semgrep returns no findings or the user prompts the IDE to ignore Semgrep's findings.

This article includes instructions for setting up the MCP server with Cursor and Claude Code, but it also works with any IDE-based MCP client.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* Python 3.10 or later
* Homebrew or Pip to install Semgrep
* A Semgrep account

## Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

### Cursor[​](#cursor "Direct link to Cursor")

1. Install Semgrep:

   ```
   # install through homebrewbrew install semgrep# install through pippython3 -m pip install semgrep
   ```

2. Verify that you've installed the [latest version](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/releases) of Semgrep by running the following:

   ```
   semgrep --version
   ```

3. Log in to Semgrep and install Semgrep Pro:

   ```
   semgrep login && semgrep install-semgrep-pro
   ```

4. [Add Semgrep to Cursor](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=semgrep\&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoic2VtZ3JlcCBtY3AifQ%3D%3D). Review the prefilled information and click **Install** to proceed.

5. Create a `hooks.json` file in your project's `.cursor` directory and paste the following configuration:

   ```
   {"version": 1,"hooks": {    "stop": [    {        "command": "semgrep mcp -k stop-cli-scan -a cursor"    }    ],    "afterFileEdit": [    {        "command": "semgrep mcp -k record-file-edit -a cursor"    }    ]}}
   ```

6. Restart Cursor to apply hook configuration.

### Claude Code[​](#claude-code "Direct link to Claude Code")

1. Install Semgrep:

   ```
   # install through homebrewbrew install semgrep# install through pippython3 -m pip install semgrep
   ```

2. Verify that you've installed the [latest version](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/releases) of Semgrep by running the following:

   ```
   semgrep --version
   ```

3. Start a new Claude Code instance in the terminal:

   ```
   claude
   ```

4. Add the Semgrep marketplace to Claude:

   ```
   /plugin marketplace add semgrep/mcp-marketplace
   ```

5. Install the Semgrep plugin:

   ```
   /plugin install semgrep-plugin@semgrep
   ```

6. Set up the Semgrep plugin:

   ```
   /semgrep-plugin:setup_semgrep_plugin# if the preceding command doesn't work, try:/plugin enable semgrep-plugin@semgrep
   ```

### Other IDEs[​](#other-ides "Direct link to Other IDEs")

1. Install Semgrep:

   ```
   # install through homebrewbrew install semgrep# install through pippython3 -m pip install semgrep
   ```

2. Verify that you've installed the [latest version](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/releases) of Semgrep by running the following:

   ```
   semgrep --version
   ```

3. Sign in to your Semgrep account. Running this command launches a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed:

   ```
   semgrep login
   ```

   In the **Semgrep CLI login**, click **Activate** to proceed.

4. Return to the CLI, and install the Semgrep Pro engine:

   ```
   semgrep install-semgrep-pro
   ```

5. Add the Semgrep MCP Server to your IDE. Semgrep provides [sample configuration information](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/tree/develop/cli/src/semgrep/mcp#integrations) that you can use as a starting point for your configuration. Refer to your IDE's documentation for specific details on where to add the MCP server configuration information.

## Scan your code[​](#scan-your-code "Direct link to Scan your code")

1. Open up your IDE's AI chat window.
2. Ensure that you're in the correct context to use Semgrep.
3. Prompt your IDE to scan with Semgrep.

By default, the MCP Server runs all three Semgrep products: Code, Supply Chain, and Secrets.
