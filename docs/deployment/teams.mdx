Use the **Access** page to manage membership and access to Semgrep resources, such as scans, projects, and findings. **Projects** are repositories or codebases you have added to SCP for scanning.

## User roles and access[​](#user-roles-and-access "Direct link to User roles and access")

Accounts enable you to manage access to Semgrep resources, such as scans, projects, and findings, with varying levels of collaboration and visibility. Basic access control is managed through the **Users** tab.

A user is any person who has been added to your organization in Semgrep.

Semgrep primarily divides users into three roles:

* `admin`
* `member`
* `readonly`

Optionally, you can appoint members to a fourth role: the **manager** role. Managers are a subset of members with some additional capabilities and scopes. In particular, they are able to assign specific projects to members through the creation of [teams](#teams-beta).

<Info>
  * Users are assigned a role based on your [organization's default](#set-a-default-role). New organizations are created with a default role of `admin`.
</Info>

### User permissions and visibility[​](#user-permissions-and-visibility "Direct link to User permissions and visibility")

Admins have full permissions, scopes, and visibility into all aspects of Semgrep.

Members can edit the following page:

* **Findings**. They can view **all projects** in the Findings page, and can sort and triage findings.

Members can view the following pages:

* **Dashboard**. They are able to see the total count of findings for all projects in the org.
* **Editor**. They can view an org's rules, but they can't write rules for the org. They can still write rules for their personal Semgrep orgs.
* **Registry**. They can view, but not add, rules and rule packs.
* **Docs**. Anyone can view the docs.

Members can't view or perform any actions in the following pages:

* Policies
* Projects
* Settings

### Invite a team member through email[​](#invite-a-team-member-through-email "Direct link to Invite a team member through email")

Add team members easily to your organization by sending them an email. This email contains instructions for them to join your org through the same auth provider configured for your account. The invitation only facilitates access for users who are already provisioned in the configured auth provider.

You must be an `admin` to perform this operation.

1. Sign in to [Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **Settings > Access**. This brings you to the **Users** tab.
3. Click **Invite users**.
4. In the dialog, enter your team members' email addresses. You can invite up to 20 users at a time. Separate each email address with a `Space` or `Tab` key. You can also paste a comma-separated list of email addresses.
5. Click **Send invites**.

### Change a user's role[​](#change-a-users-role "Direct link to Change a user's role")

You must be an `admin` to perform this operation.

1. Sign in to [Semgrep Cloud Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **Settings > Access**.
3. Search for the user whose role will be changed.
4. Click on the user's current role, under the role header. A drop-down box appears.
5. Select the new role for the user.

<Note>
  You cannot change your own role.
</Note>

### Set a default role[​](#set-a-default-role "Direct link to Set a default role")

Organizations start with a default role of `admin`.

To change this, perform the following steps:

1. In Semgrep AppSec Platform, click **Settings**.
2. Click **Access > Defaults**.

## Teams (beta)[​](#teams-beta "Direct link to Teams (beta)")

The **Teams (beta)** feature enables admins to grant or limit access to **specific projects** in Semgrep AppSec Platform (SCP). This provides more granular control than the [**Users** feature](#user-permissions-and-visibility).

You can quickly assign projects to large groups of users by first assigning users to teams and subteams within your organization.

This feature helps security engineers and developers in large organizations focus on the projects that are relevant to their specific department or team.

When you limit a user's access to a subset of your projects, their **Dashboard** and **Findings** pages all reflect that change. For example, their total finding count is based on the total number of findings of the projects they can access.

This document walks you through the following:

* How to approach team management and project access in Semgrep
* How to create, view, update, and delete teams and subteams
* How to assign or unassign projects to teams

## Roles and access[​](#roles-and-access "Direct link to Roles and access")

The Teams feature extends the existing roles defined in the **Users** tab.

* * Admin
  * Member
  * Readonly

  * A user who has access to all features, resources, and projects of their Semgrep deployment. Admins can also change the role of members and managers.
  * When creating teams, admins are automatically included in all teams and can't be removed from any team. The access of an admin cannot be restricted except by making them a member.
  * An org admin can change the role of any other user, including a fellow admin.

  * A user who has access to some features, resources, and projects of their Semgrep deployment.
  * To grant members access to a project and its findings, you must add the members to a team, and that team must be assigned to the project.
  * Members can scan their local or personal repositories through a personal account.
  * Members can also be assigned as **Managers** within a team.

  * A user who can only view projects and issues of their Semgrep deployment.

A fourth role, **the manager**, can be assigned within the context of a team. Managers are a subset of members:

* Manager

  * A member who can grant access to projects by creating subteams and assigning members to these subteams.
  * A manager role is restricted to the teams where they have been assigned as a manager. Users can be managers of some projects, but members for others. For more information, see the [manager role](#the-manager-role).

<Info>
  Members and managers can create projects by scanning a repository using the Semgrep CLI tool, but they can't access the project related to the repository in Semgrep AppSec Platform unless an admin provides them explicit access to the project.

## How team access works[​](#how-team-access-works "Direct link to How team access works")

* Members of a top-level team gain access to the projects of its subteams. They are indirect members of a subteam.
* Members of a subteam do not have access to the projects of teams or subteams above it.

In the following diagram, team 1 gains access to subteam 1b's projects, but team 1b does not gain access to projects from team 1.

![Team scopes diagram](/images/docs/deployment/docs/assets/images/access-diagram-038e7132f085cf2adbc652f67ad56477.png)

* The members Alexis, Pam, and Raj have access to the following projects:

  * App
  * Microservices
  * Frontend

* The members David, Sebas, and Phaedra have access to the following projects:
  * Frontend

### The manager role[​](#the-manager-role "Direct link to The manager role")

Use the **manager role** to delegate the assignment of projects across many users. Managers can speed up the deployment of Semgrep into your organization by creating subteams to grant members access to projects.

Given a security engineer who is a manager of **team A** but a member of **team B**, with both teams having the same projects:

* The security engineer has manager **access** to the projects.
* The security engineer can create subteams for team A but can't create subteams for team B.

Additionally, the manager role is able to perform the following:

* Scan, including managed scans on new projects through the **Projects** page.
* Edit projects that their team is assigned to.

Managers cannot remove themselves from their team. Admins and co-managers of the same team or subteam can remove other managers.

#### Assign team members to projects[​](#assign-team-members-to-projects "Direct link to Assign team members to projects")

<Info>
  This feature is currently in invite-only beta. Please contact [Semgrep Support](/docs/support) for more information.
</Info>

Managers can view their subteams through the **Settings > Access > My teams** tab. Within this tab, they are also able to assign any of the projects they manage from one subteam to another.

For example, if Bob is a manager of `Team A` (assigned to projects `Foo` and `Bar`) and `Team B` (assigned to project `Baz`), Bob has access to all three projects: `Foo`, `Bar`, and `Baz`. Bob can also assign `Baz` to `Team A`.

Note that this feature enables managers to view **all projects**, even projects they are not assigned to, in the **Edit teams** panel. While they are able to view projects in this panel, they still can't perform any admin-level operations, including assigning projects they're not a manager of.

## Enable teams[​](#enable-teams "Direct link to Enable teams")

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Click **[Settings > Access > Teams](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/access/teams)**.
3. Optional: Click **Yes, add new users to the default team** if you want new members and projects to be added to the default team.
4. Click **Enable**.
5. Read the dialog box to ensure that your settings are correct, then click **Enable beta**.

When you have enabled teams for the first time, a team is automatically created with the name of your deployment. This preserves the settings you previously had using the **Users** feature; all current members retain their existing projects.

## Tips for creating teams and subteams[​](#tips-for-creating-teams-and-subteams "Direct link to Tips for creating teams and subteams")

<Info>
  The Semgrep team recommends that admins assign projects to one team only.
</Info>

* **Use subteams to grant access to a specific department's repositories**: Create a top-level team for managers or security engineers in your organization who have broad access to a variety of repositories, then create subteams for members to grant them limited access to their specific department's repositories.
* **Use flat teams to grant access to central projects that are used by a broad group of developers**: It is best to create a separate flat team, without any subteams, and grant the users access to foundational or central repositories from that team. For example, projects that all engineers commit to can be named the Engineering Team.
