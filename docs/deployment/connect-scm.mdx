* [Deployment](/docs/tags/deployment)
* [Semgrep AppSec Platform](/docs/tags/semgrep-app-sec-platform)


<Note>
  * You have gained the necessary [resource access and permissions](/docs/deployment/checklist) required for deployment.
  * You have [created a Semgrep account and organization](/docs/deployment/create-account-and-orgs).
</Note>

Linking a source code manager provides the following benefits:

* Allows the Semgrep org membership to be managed by GitHub or GitLab.

* For GitHub users:

  * Provides Semgrep access to post PR or MR comments.
  * For GitHub Actions users: Enables you to add a Semgrep CI job to repositories in bulk.

* Allows you to scan and manage your Azure DevOps and Bitbucket projects in Semgrep AppSec Platform.

* Allows the Semgrep platform to generate hyperlinks to code in findings.

If your organization uses both GitHub and GitLab to manage source code, log in with the source code manager that you would prefer to use to manage Semgrep org membership. You can still scan repositories from other sources, including Azure DevOps and Bitbucket, though you will need to use a separate SSO provider to manage the authentication of your users in such cases.

The process to connect a source code manager depends on whether your SCM tool is cloud-hosted by the service provider, hosted on-premise, or hosted as a single tenant by the service provider.

## Connect to cloud-hosted orgs[​](#connect-to-cloud-hosted-orgs "Direct link to Connect to cloud-hosted orgs")

If you opted to scan a GitHub or GitLab repository when you initially signed in, you may have already performed these steps and can skip to [Next steps](#next-steps).

  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    If your GitHub Enterprise instance contains many orgs, you must **choose an org** among your accounts that acts as the **owner** of the Semgrep App. As the owner, this org controls the settings and permissions granted to the app. Throughout the setup process, ensure that you select this org consistently when prompted.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    Perform the following steps to set up the connection:
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).

    2. Optional: If you have created more than one Semgrep account, select the account you want to make a connection for by clicking on the **Navigation bar > Your account name > The account you want to connect**.

       ![](/images/docs/deployment/docs/img/more-accounts-dropdown.png)

    3. From the **Navigation bar**, click **Settings > Source code managers**.

    4. Click **Add > GitHub Enterprise**.

    5. In the **Connect your GitHub Organization** dialog that appears, provide:

       * The **URL** used to access the GitHub instance

    6. Add the Semgrep GitHub App:

       1. Under **Enter GitHub information**, indicate that you want to install the app on your **Organization**, and select the **Organization name** where the app is installed. If you have multiple GitHub organizations that you'd like to use with Semgrep, ensure that you select the **Use for multiple GitHub orgs** box.
       2. Under **Select features to enable**, indicate whether you would like to grant code access to Semgrep.
       3. Review the permissions requested by Semgrep.
       4. Click **Register a Semgrep GitHub App**. Semgrep asks if you'd like to be redirected to GitHub to continue creating the app. Click **Continue** to proceed.
       5. You are taken to your GHE instance and asked to name your app. You can choose whatever name you'd like, but Semgrep recommends that you name it something that indicates that this is the Semgrep GHE app.
       6. After you name your app, choose the GHE org you want to install it on.
       7. Select the org, then click **Install**.
       8. Wait for the installation to complete. When done, you are redirected to Semgrep.
       9. Verify the installation by navigating to **Settings** > **Source code managers**. Ensure that the entry for your GitHub organization shows a **Connected** badge.
       10. In GHE, you should see the app listed as installed on the **GitHub Apps** page.
           * You can click **Configure** to choose the repositories to which the app has access. Additionally, you can go to **App settings** to customize the permissions granted to the app.

    7. If you have additional GHE orgs you'd like to add, you can do so by repeating the previous steps 1-6.

       At this point, you've successfully installed the GHE Semgrep App on the owner GHE org. In the future, other members of your GHE instance can install the app on their GHE orgs using the public link if they have the proper permissions. You can get the public link from GHE by going to **GitHub Apps** > **App settings**.
