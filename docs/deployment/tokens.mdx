An access token is a secure credential used to authorize requests to Semgrep AppSec Platform or the Semgrep API without a username and password. Each token is associated with a specific Semgrep account and has a defined set of [scopes](#token-scopes) that determine the permissions granted to its bearer.

## Types of access tokens[​](#types-of-access-tokens "Direct link to Types of access tokens")

Semgrep uses the following types of access tokens:

* API tokens
* CLI tokens
* Service tokens

### API tokens[​](#api-tokens "Direct link to API tokens")

API tokens can be created by admins and are used for calls to the Semgrep API and to set up third-party integrations. For auditing purposes, API tokens are associated with the user who created them. However, they remain valid until manually revoked, even if the creator is no longer associated with the deployment.

### CLI tokens[​](#cli-tokens "Direct link to CLI tokens")

CLI tokens authenticate users who run scans or publish rules from the Semgrep CLI. Both members and admins of a deployment can create CLI tokens. The CLI token allows users to run scans on their local machine using the `semgrep ci` command. This sends findings data to Semgrep AppSec Platform. It also allows users to [publish rules](/docs/writing-rules/private-rules#creating-private-rules) using `semgrep publish`.

For auditing purposes, Semgrep [records the user who generated the CLI token](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens/cli), but the user's actions are attributed to the token rather than the user.

Logging out of the Semgrep CLI with `semgrep logout` removes the local token, but it does not invalidate it.

### Service tokens[​](#service-tokens "Direct link to Service tokens")

Service tokens are functionally the same as API tokens, but instead of being manually generated by a user, they are automatically generated during repository onboarding for CI/CD scans or when repositories are added to Semgrep AppSec Platform. These tokens authenticate agents running automated scans. The default scope for these tokens is Agent/CI, but admins can edit the token and grant them the API scope as well.

## Token scopes[​](#token-scopes "Direct link to Token scopes")

The following table displays the scopes assigned to each token:

| Token        | Send findings from a remote repository | Send findings from a local repository | Connect to Semgrep API |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| API          | ❌ No                                   | ❌ No                                  | ✔️ Yes                 |
| CLI          | ❌ No                                   | ✔️ Yes                                | ❌ No                   |
| Service (CI) | ✔️ Yes                                 | ✔️ Yes                                | ❌ No                   |

The following table displays typical uses for token scopes:

| Token        | Use                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API          | Used to access Semgrep's API                                                                                                                                                              |
| CLI          | Auto-generated by Semgrep when a user is logging in through Semgrep CLI. Use this token to scan your code locally using your organization's configured policies, including private rules. |
| Service (CI) | Generated by Semgrep when onboarding (adding) a repository to Semgrep AppSec Platform.                                                                                                    |

## View and manage tokens[​](#view-and-manage-tokens "Direct link to View and manage tokens")

You can view a list of tokens for your deployment [in Semgrep AppSec Platform under **Settings > Tokens**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens).

Each token type has its own page that lists all existing tokens of that type. Use the search bar to help find a specific token.

For **API tokens**, you can use the drop-down menu to view only those tokens associated with specific roles, such as **Admin** or **Member**.

For **Service tokens**, you can use the drop-down menu to view tokens for specific services, such as **Semgrep Managed Scans**, **Click to Fix**, or **AI Scan**.

### Create an API token[​](#create-an-api-token "Direct link to Create an API token")

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Go to [**Settings > Tokens > API tokens**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens/api).
3. Click **Create new token**.
4. Copy the **Secrets name** and the **Secrets value**, and save these values. The **Secrets value** is your token and is only shown at this time.
5. Select the **Token scopes**.
6. Optional: change the **Name** of the token. This is the value used in the list of tokens associated with your Semgrep deployment.
7. Click **Save** to proceed.

### Create a CLI token[​](#create-a-cli-token "Direct link to Create a CLI token")

Once you've [set up the Semgrep CLI](/docs/getting-started/cli#set-up-semgrep), create a CLI token by running the following command:

```
semgrep login
```

Running this command launches a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed. In the **Semgrep CLI login** window, click **Activate** to proceed.

### Edit a token[​](#edit-a-token "Direct link to Edit a token")

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Go to **Settings > Tokens**.
3. Go to one of the following pages based on the type of token you're interested in: **API tokens**, **CLI tokens**, or **Semgrep service tokens**.
4. Find the token, and click **Edit**.
5. In the dialog that appears, change the **Token scopes** or the displayed **Name**.
6. Click **Save** to proceed.

### Revoke a token[​](#revoke-a-token "Direct link to Revoke a token")

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Go to **Settings > Tokens**.
3. Go to one of the following pages based on the type of token you're interested in: **API tokens**, **CLI tokens**, or **Semgrep service tokens**.
4. Find the token, and click **Revoke**.
