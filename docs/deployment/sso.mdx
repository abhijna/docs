<Note>
  * You have gained the necessary [resource access and permissions](/docs/deployment/checklist) required for deployment.
  * You have [created a Semgrep account and organization](/docs/deployment/create-account-and-orgs).
  * You are an admin for both your Semgrep deployment and your IdP provider.
  * For GitHub and GitLab users: You have [connected your source code manager](/docs/deployment/connect-scm).
</Note>

This article walks you through single-sign on (SSO) configuration. Semgrep supports SSO through [OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0](#openid-connect--oauth-20) and [SAML 2.0](#saml-20).

After setting up SSO, users are provisioned and managed on your IdP. Semgrep grants access to the deployment to any user at the configured domain who logs in and has the correct permissions in the IdP.

    To set up SSO in Semgrep AppSec Platform:
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
    2. Go to [**Settings > Access > Login methods**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/access/loginMethods).
    3. In the **Single sign-on (SSO)** section, provide a valid **Email domain**, then click **Initialize**.
    4. The **Configure Single Sign-On** dialog appears. Begin by selecting your identity provider, or choose **Custom OIDC**.
    5. Follow the instructions provided on the subsequent **Configure Single Sign-On** dialog pages to complete this process. When you've completed the required steps, use **Test sign-in** to test the connection.
    6. Once test sign-in has passed, close the test page. Verify that the **Connection details** shown on the **Connection activated** screen are correct and close the dialog.
    7. Verify that the **Connection status** is now **active** under the **Single sign-on (SSO)** section in Semgrep AppSec Platform.
    8. To use the new connection, log out of Semgrep, then log back in using SSO.

       | When you've completed the required steps, use **Test sign-in** to test the connection. |                                  |

    8. Once test sign-in has passed, close the test page. Verify that the **Connection details** shown on the **Connection activated** screen are correct and close the dialog.

    9. Verify that the **Connection status** is now **active** under the **Single sign-on (SSO)** section in Semgrep AppSec Platform.

</Tabs>

If you encounter issues during the setup process, [reach out to support](/docs/support) for assistance.

<Note>
  By default, Semgrep creates new SSO accounts with the **Member** role assigned. You can change the default role assigned to a new user by going to [Settings > Access](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/access/defaults).

  If you're an admin setting up SSO, and Semgrep creates an SSO account for you with the role of **Member**, you can elevate the permissions granted to your SSO account. To do so, log in to Semgrep with your admin account using the original login method, then [change the role](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/access/members) of your newly created SSO account to **Admin**.
</Note>

### Turn off sign in with GitHub / GitLab[​](#turn-off-sign-in-with-github--gitlab "Direct link to Turn off sign in with GitHub / GitLab")

If you have SSO enabled, you can turn off login using GitHub or GitLab credentials. Doing so forces members of your organization to log in using an email address with an approved domain.

1. Sign in to your [Semgrep account](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Navigate to [**Settings > Access > Login methods**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/docs-test/settings/access/loginMethods).
3. GitHub users: Click the **GitHub SSO** toggle to turn off logins using GitHub.
4. GitLab users: Click the **GitLab SSO** toggle to turn off logins using GitLab.

<Warning>
  Ensure that you have at least one user who can log in as an admin through SSO before disabling sign in with GitHub or GitLab.
</Warning>
