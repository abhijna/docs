This article shows you how to customize your local scans with Semgrep Community Edition (CE). Before proceeding with this article, ensure that you are familiar with [scanning a project using Semgrep CE](/docs/getting-started/quickstart-ce).

## Scan your codebase and export results[​](#scan-your-codebase-and-export-results "Direct link to Scan your codebase and export results")

Navigate to the root of your codebase to run first scan. The specific command you use depends on how you want to view the results.

To view the results in the CLI:

```
semgrep scan
```

To export the results to a plain text file:

```
semgrep scan --text --text-output=semgrep.txt
```

To export the results to a SARIF file:

```
semgrep scan --sarif --sarif-output=semgrep.sarif
```

To export the results to a JSON file:

```
semgrep scan --json --json-output=semgrep.json
```

> The JSON schema for Semgrep's CLI output can be found in [semgrep/semgrep-interfaces](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-interfaces/blob/main/semgrep_output_v1.jsonschema).

In addition to the `--text`, `--json`, and `--sarif` flags, which set the primary output formats, and the `--output=<value>` flag that saves the results to a file or posts to a URL, you can append `--<format>-output=<file>` to obtain additional output streams:

```
# prints findings in SARIF format to standard output and writes in JSON format to `findings.json`.semgrep scan --sarif --json-output=findings.json# prints findings in text to standard out and writes JSON output to `findings.json`.semgrep scan --json-output=findings.json# prints text output to `findings.txt` and writes in SARIF to `findings.sarif`.semgrep scan --output=findings.txt --sarif-output=findings.sarif# writes text to `semgrep.txt`, JSON to `semgrep.json`, and SARIF to `semgrep.sarif`.semgrep scan --text --output=semgrep.txt --json-output=semgrep.json --sarif-output=semgrep.sarif
```

Accepted values for `<format>`: `text`, `json`, `sarif`, `gitlab-sast`, `gitlab-secrets`, `junit-xml`, `emacs`, `vim`

## Scan your codebase with a specific ruleset[​](#scan-your-codebase-with-a-specific-ruleset "Direct link to Scan your codebase with a specific ruleset")

You can scan your codebase using `--config auto` to run Semgrep with rules that apply to your programming languages and frameworks:

```
semgrep scan --config auto
```

<Info>
  Semgrep collects pseudonymous metrics when you use rules from the Registry. You can turn this off with `--metrics=off`.
</Info>

To scan your codebase with a specific ruleset, either one that you write or one that you obtain from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore), use the `--config` flag.

```
# Scan with the the JavaScript rules from Semgrep Registrysemgrep scan --config p/javascript
```

```
# Scan with the rules defined in your custom rules.yaml filesemgrep scan --config rules.yaml
```

You can include as many configuration flags as necessary.

```
# Scan with rules defined in two separate config filessemgrep scan --config rules.yaml --config more_rules.yaml
```

Rules stored under a **hidden directory**, such as `dir/.hidden/myrule.yml`, are processed by Semgrep when scanning with the `--config` flag.

Scan with rules in a **directory** and **all** its subdirectories:

```
semgrep scan --config DIRECTORY_NAME
```

Scan with all YAML rules detected in the **current working directory** and all its **subdirectories**:

```
semgrep scan --config .
```

#### Test custom rules[​](#test-custom-rules "Direct link to Test custom rules")

Semgrep includes features to [test the custom rules that you write](/docs/writing-rules/testing-rules):

```
semgrep scan --test
```

## Improve performance for large codebases[​](#improve-performance-for-large-codebases "Direct link to Improve performance for large codebases")

You can set the number of subprocesses Semgrep uses to run checks in parallel:

```
semgrep scan -j NUMBER_OF_SUBPROCESSES
```

By default, the number of jobs Semgrep uses is equivalent to the number of cores detected on the system.

> Semgrep doesn't currently support parallelism on Windows.

## Set log levels[​](#set-log-levels "Direct link to Set log levels")

Semgrep provides three levels of logging:

| **Log level** | **Flag**            | **Description**                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default       | None                | Prints scan progress, findings information, warnings, and errors.                                                           |
| Verbose       | `-v` or `--verbose` | Includes everything printed when using the default logging level, adding a list of rules and details such as skipped files. |
| Debug         | `--debug`           | Logs the entire scan process at a high level of detail.                                                                     |

### Example usage[​](#example-usage "Direct link to Example usage")

To set the logging level for a scan, include the flag when scanning your project:

```
# run a scan and get debug logssemgrep scan --debug
```

## Exit codes[​](#exit-codes "Direct link to Exit codes")

The command `semgrep scan` finishes with exit code `0` as long as the scan completes, regardless of whether there were findings. To finish with exit code `1` when there are findings, pass in the `--error` flag.
