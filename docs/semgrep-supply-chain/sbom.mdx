<Info>
  At least one repository that scans for dependencies through Semgrep Supply Chain. See [Scan third-party dependencies](/docs/semgrep-supply-chain/getting-started).
</Info>

Generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) to assess your third-party dependencies and comply with auditing procedures. Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC) can generate an SBOM for each repository you have added to Semgrep AppSec Platform. When generating an SBOM, Semgrep uses:

* The vulnerability information from the default branch for the project
* The dependency information from the latest full scan for the project.

## Supported standards and formats[​](#supported-standards-and-formats "Direct link to Supported standards and formats")

Semgrep Supply Chain supports the following SBOM formats:

* CycloneDX 1.4 JSON
* CycloneDX 1.4 XML

## Generate and download an SBOM for a single project[​](#generate-and-download-an-sbom-for-a-single-project "Direct link to Generate and download an SBOM for a single project")

SBOM generation can be performed through Semgrep AppSec Platform or the [Semgrep API](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/SupplyChainService/operation/SupplyChainService_CreateSbomExport).

1. In Semgrep AppSec Platform, go to **Supply Chain > Dependencies**.
2. Click the **Download** icon next to the repository you want an SBOM for.
3. Click the format you want the SBOM to be in. After clicking, refresh or leave the page only after the SBOM has been generated.
4. Once Semgrep has generated the SBOM, click the link on the toaster notification to download it.

You have successfully downloaded an SBOM.

<Note>
  Typically, full scans are run only on primary (default) branches. However, if your workflow differs and you run full scans on non-primary branches, this can create a mismatch between dependencies and vulnerabilities in the generated SBOM. To avoid the mismatch, ensure that the latest full scan runs on the primary branch of the repository for which you want to generate an SBOM.
</Note>

### Generate an SBOM through the API[​](#generate-an-sbom-through-the-api "Direct link to Generate an SBOM through the API")

Refer to the [Semgrep API > SBOM documentation](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/SupplyChainService/operation/SupplyChainService_CreateSbomExport).

## Semgrep-specific SBOM data fields[​](#semgrep-specific-sbom-data-fields "Direct link to Semgrep-specific SBOM data fields")

In addition to the [minimum elements that define an SBOM](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf), Semgrep provides additional metadata in the `vulnerabilities` field. Nested under the `vulnerabilities` field is a list of data objects describing a specific vulnerability. Each data object contains the following data fields:

| Semgrep-specific field | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
