Copy as md

The Semgrep Network Broker facilitates secure access between Semgrep and your private network. The Network Broker creates a WireGuard VPN tunnel to the Semgrep backend and proxies **inbound** HTTP requests from Semgrep to the customer through the tunnel. This allows Semgrep to communicate with private network resources like a Source Code Manager (SCM) without exposing them to the public internet.

Examples of inbound traffic include:

* [Pull request comments](/docs/category/pr-or-mr-comments)
* Code access for [Semgrep Managed Scans](/docs/deployment/managed-scanning/overview) if enabled
* [Webhooks](/docs/semgrep-appsec-platform/webhooks)

## Feature Availability[​](#feature-availability "Direct link to Feature Availability")

<Info>
  The Semgrep Network Broker is available to Enterprise tier users.
</Info>

The Semgrep Network Broker is a feature that must be enabled in your Semgrep organization before setup. It is only available to paying customers. Contact the [Semgrep support team](/docs/support) to discuss having it enabled for your organization.

If you will be using the Network Broker with a dedicated Semgrep tenant, please note that in your request.

## Deployment[​](#deployment "Direct link to Deployment")

The Network Broker can be run as a bare Docker container, in a Kubernetes cluster, or simply as a standalone binary on a machine.

Only one instance of the WireGuard-based Network Broker can be run at any time. Multiple brokers with the same configuration can cause disconnects, instability, and package loss.

### System Requirements[​](#system-requirements "Direct link to System Requirements")

* CPU: 1
* RAM: 512 MB

### Network Requirements[​](#network-requirements "Direct link to Network Requirements")

* Between Semgrep and Broker:

  * Allow traffic from `wireguard.semgrep.dev` on UDP port 51820. If you are on a dedicated Semgrep tenant, allow traffic from `wireguard.<tenant-name>.semgrep.dev` instead.
  * If using the `--deployment-id` CLI flag, allow outbound to `semgrep.dev` on TCP port 443 for HTTPS.

* Between Broker and each private network resource, enable outbound on TCP ports 80 and 443 for HTTP/HTTPS communication.

<Info>
  To determine the IP addresses for a domain, use dig. The addresses are listed under the ANSWER section. Example: `dig wireguard.semgrep.dev`
</Info>

### Artifacts[​](#artifacts "Direct link to Artifacts")

You can choose between deploying pre-made artifacts or building your own.

#### Pre-built by Semgrep[​](#pre-built-by-semgrep "Direct link to Pre-built by Semgrep")

* Docker images are available from [ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker/pkgs/container/semgrep-network-broker).
* A sample [Kubernetes Manifest](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker/blob/develop/kubernetes.yaml) is present within the repository. This should be extended for production.

#### Build Yourself[​](#build-yourself "Direct link to Build Yourself")

See the [Network Broker repository](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker)'s README for instructions on how to build it yourself.

## Configure Semgrep Network Broker[​](#configure-semgrep-network-broker "Direct link to Configure Semgrep Network Broker")

Ensure that you are logged in to the server where you want to run Semgrep Network Broker. Complete the following steps while logged in to that server.

### Create the config file[​](#create-the-config-file "Direct link to Create the config file")

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="v0.25.0 and later">
    Create a `config.yaml` file similar to the following snippet, or copy a starting config from the Semgrep AppSec Platform at **Settings > Broker**. The steps required to generate values for the placeholders `SEMGREP_LOCAL_ADDRESS`, `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `YOUR_BASE_URL`, as well as the scopes required for the access tokens, are provided in subsequent steps of this guide.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="v0.24.0 and earlier">
    ```
      inbound:    wireguard:      localAddress: SEMGREP_LOCAL_ADDRESS      privateKey: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY      peers:        - endpoint: wireguard.semgrep.dev:51820    allowlist: []    gitlab:      baseUrl: YOUR_BASE_URL
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    <Note>
      Semgrep recommends that users running Network Broker v0.24.0 or earlier to upgrade to v0.25.0 or later. This enables the use of a simplified config file.

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Multiple configuration files[​](#multiple-configuration-files "Direct link to Multiple configuration files")

You can overlay multiple configuration files on top of each other by passing multiple `-c` arguments:

```
semgrep-network-broker -c config1.yaml -c config2.yaml -c config3.yaml
```

Note that arrays are replaced, while maps are merged.

### Generate a keypair[​](#generate-a-keypair "Direct link to Generate a keypair")

The broker requires a WireGuard keypair to establish a secure connection. To generate your private key to replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` in the config template:

1. Determine the [Network Broker version](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker/pkgs/container/semgrep-network-broker) you want to use. The format should be similar to `v0.22.0`. Most users should use the latest version, especially when setting up the broker for the first time.
2. Run the following command in the CLI to generate your private key, replacing the placeholder with the Network Broker version number:
   ```
   docker run ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:VERSION_NUMBER genkey
   ```
3. Run the following command in the CLI to generate your public key, replacing the placeholders with your private key generated in the previous step and the Network Broker version number:

```
echo "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY" | sudo docker run -i ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:VERSION_NUMBER pubkey
```

<Info>
  Your public key is safe to share. Do **not** share your private key with anyone, including Semgrep.
</Info>

### Update the config with the keypair[​](#update-the-config-with-the-keypair "Direct link to Update the config with the keypair")

1. Update the `config.yaml` file by replacing `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with the value of your private key.

2. Add your public key to the Semgrep AppSec Platform:

   1. Log in to Semgrep AppSec Platform.
   2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Broker**.
   3. Paste your public key and click **Add Public Key**.

### Update the config with your SCM information[​](#update-the-config-with-your-scm-information "Direct link to Update the config with your SCM information")

Update the `config.yaml` by replacing the SCM information containing `YOUR_BASE_URL` with your SCM and its base URL for Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket Data Center.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Azure DevOps">
    ```
    azuredevops:
      baseURL: https://ADO_BASE_URL/*
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bitbucket">
    Bitbucket is compatible with Network Broker versions 0.20.0 and later.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    ```
    bitbucket:
      baseURL: https://BITBUCKET_BASE_URL/rest/api/latest
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitLab">
    ```
    github:
      baseURL: https://GITHUB_BASE_URL/api/v3
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    ```
    gitlab:
      baseURL: https://GITLAB_BASE_URL/api/v4
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add your local address to the config[​](#add-your-local-address-to-the-config "Direct link to Add your local address to the config")

1. Convert your organization ID to hexadecimal. The organization ID is found in Semgrep AppSec Platform under [**Settings > General > Identifiers**](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/general/identifiers) in Semgrep AppSec Platform. This is sometimes also called a deployment ID. You can use a tool such as [Decimal to Hexadecimal converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) to perform the conversion if needed.
2. Embed the resulting hexadecimal value in the string `fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be8:0:ORGANIZATION_ID:0:1`, replacing `ORGANIZATION_ID` with the value.
3. Update the `localAddress` field of `config.yaml`, replacing `SEMGREP_LOCAL_ADDRESS` with the string you generated in Step 2.

```
inbound:  wireguard:    localAddress: fdf0:59dc:33cf:9be8:0:ORGANIZATION_ID:0:1
```

### Start the broker[​](#start-the-broker "Direct link to Start the broker")

Run the following command to start Semgrep Network Broker with your completed configuration file:

```
sudo docker run -d -it --rm -v $(pwd):/emt ghcr.io/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker:VERSION_NUMBER -c /emt/config.yaml
```

## Check Semgrep Network Broker logs[​](#check-semgrep-network-broker-logs "Direct link to Check Semgrep Network Broker logs")

You can check the logs for Semgrep Network Broker by running:

```
sudo docker logs CONTAINER_ID
```

### Adjusting log verbosity[​](#adjusting-log-verbosity "Direct link to Adjusting log verbosity")

The Semgrep Network Broker can log details of the proxied requests and responses for troubleshooting. To log additional details, add this snippet to your broker configuration:

<Warning>
  Please enable these settings only while working to identify issues. Otherwise, significant memory in the tunnel is used on large request and response bodies.
</Warning>

```
inbound:  logging:    logRequestBody: true    logResponseBody: true
```

In the logs, this leads to entries for `proxy.request` and `proxy.response`.

These values can also be set on a per-allowlist basis:

```
inbound:  allowlist:    - url: https://httpbin.org/*      methods: [GET, POST]      logRequestBody: true      logResponseBody: true
```

This provides additional flexibility when troubleshooting. See the [broker README](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-network-broker?tab=readme-ov-file#logging) for more details.

### Enable verbose WireGuard logging[​](#enable-verbose-wireguard-logging "Direct link to Enable verbose WireGuard logging")

To troubleshoot connection issues potentially related to the WireGuard configuration, you can enable verbose logging by adding the following snippet to the broker configuration:

```
inbound:  wireguard:    verbose: true
```

## Use Semgrep Network Broker with Managed Scans[​](#use-semgrep-network-broker-with-managed-scans "Direct link to Use Semgrep Network Broker with Managed Scans")

Semgrep Managed Scans uses Semgrep Network Broker to connect to your internal source code management instance.

To enable Managed Scans when using Network Broker, ensure that you've updated your SCM information to allow code access:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Azure DevOps">
    ```
    azuredevops:
      baseURL: https://ADO_BASE_URL/*
      allowCodeAccess: true
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bitbucket">
    <Info>
      Semgrep recommends providing the access token when you [connect the source code manager](/docs/deployment/connect-scm#connect-to-cloud-hosted-orgs) instead of in the Network Broker configuration. However, if you must provide the token in the Network Broker configuration, see [Prerequisites and permissions](/docs/deployment/managed-scanning/azure#prerequisites-and-permissions) for access token requirements.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitHub">
    ```
    bitbucket:
      baseURL: https://BITBUCKET_BASE_URL/rest/api/latest
      allowCodeAccess: true
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="GitLab">
    <Info>
      Semgrep recommends providing the access token when you [connect the source code manager](/docs/deployment/connect-scm#connect-to-on-premise-orgs-and-projects) instead of in the Network Broker configuration. However, if you must provide the token in the Network Broker configuration, see [Prerequisites and permissions](/docs/deployment/managed-scanning/bitbucket#prerequisites-and-permissions) for access token requirements.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    ```
    github:
      baseURL: https://GITHUB_BASE_URL/api/v3
      allowCodeAccess: true
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title>
    ```
    gitlab:
      baseURL: https://GITLAB_BASE_URL/api/v4
      allowCodeAccess: true
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The Semgrep Network Broker supports repository cloning with GitHub when `allowCodeAccess` is `true`, beginning with Network Broker `v0.32.0`. For other source code managers, or earlier Network Broker versions the URL allowlist must include the base URL of your instance in order to clone repositories for scanning from **any** organization or group. For example, if your source code manager is at `https://git.example.com/`, the following allowlist will permit cloning repositories:

```
inbound:  allowlist:    # allow GET requests from https://git.example.com/*    - url: https://git.example.com/*      methods: [GET, POST]
```

Semgrep also creates and updates [GitHub Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks#checks) when performing Managed Scans on pull requests. If you are running `v0.30.0` or earlier of the Network Broker: to ensure checks can be both created and updated, add the `PATCH` method to the preceding allowlist example, or add a separate entry to allowlist check updates:

```
inbound:  allowlist:    # allow PATCH requests to update checks    - url: https://git.example.com/api/v3/repos/:owner/:repo/check-runs/:id      methods: [GET, POST, PATCH]
```

In Network Broker `v0.31.0` and later, this URL is part of the default allowlist.

## Run multiple instances of the Semgrep Network Broker[​](#run-multiple-instances-of-the-semgrep-network-broker "Direct link to Run multiple instances of the Semgrep Network Broker")

Do not attempt to run multiple instances of the Semgrep Network Broker to increase availability. Running multiple instances can result in contention and is less reliable than running a single instance.

## Allowlist multiple source code managers with one configuration file[​](#allowlist-multiple-source-code-managers-with-one-configuration-file "Direct link to Allowlist multiple source code managers with one configuration file")

It is possible to allow access to multiple source code managers (SCM) within a single configuration file. One entry for a given SCM [uses the SCM-specific key provided in the configuration file](/docs/semgrep-ci/network-broker#update-the-config-with-your-scm-information), as shown in the following example for a GitHub connection:

```
github:
  baseURL: https://GITHUB_BASE_URL/api/v3
```

Subsequent entries for the same SCM require you to modify `allowlist` and add specific information needed for the HTTP requests. The following is a sample allowlist for additional GitHub entries:

```
allowlist:
 - url: https://GITHUB_BASE_URL/api/v3/repos/:owner/:repo
    methods: [GET]
    setRequestHeaders:
      Authorization: "Bearer GITHUB_PAT"
 - url: https://GITHUB_BASE_URL/api/v3/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls
    methods: [GET]
    setRequestHeaders:
      Authorization: "Bearer GITHUB_PAT"
 - url: https://GITHUB_BASE_URL/api/v3/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number/comments
    methods: [POST]
    setRequestHeaders:
      Authorization: "Bearer GITHUB_PAT"
 - url: https://GITHUB_BASE_URL/api/v3/:owner/:repo/issues/:number/comments
    methods: [POST]
    setRequestHeaders:
      Authorization: "Bearer GITHUB_PAT"
 ...
```
