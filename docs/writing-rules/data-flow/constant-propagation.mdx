title: "Constant propagation"

* [Rule writing](/docs/tags/rule-writing)


Constant propagation tracks whether a variable *must* carry a constant value at a given point in the program. Semgrep performs constant folding when matching literal patterns. Semgrep can track Boolean, numeric, and string constants.

Semgrep AppSec Platform supports interprocedural (cross-function), interfile (cross-file) constant propagation. Semgrep Community Edition (CE) supports intrafile (single-file) constant propagation.

## `metavariable-comparison`[​](#metavariable-comparison "Direct link to metavariable-comparison")

Using constant propagation, the [`metavariable-comparison`](/docs/writing-rules/rule-syntax#metavariable-comparison) operator works with any constant variable instead of just literals.

## Mutable objects[​](#mutable-objects "Direct link to Mutable objects")

In general, Semgrep assumes that constant objects are immutable and won't be modified by function calls. This can lead to false positives, especially in languages where strings are mutable, such as C and Ruby.

The only exceptions are method calls whose returning value is ignored. In these cases, Semgrep assumes that the method call may be mutating the object that's called. This helps reduce false positives in Ruby. For example:

If constant propagation doesn't seem to work, consider whether the constant may be unexpectedly mutable. For example, given the following rule designed to taint the `REGEX` class variable:

```
rules:  - id: redos-detection    message: Potential ReDoS vulnerability detected with $REGEX    severity: HIGH    languages:      - java    mode: taint    options:      symbolic_propagation: true    pattern-sources:      - patterns:          - pattern: $REDOS          - metavariable-analysis:              analyzer: redos              metavariable: $REDOS    pattern-sinks:      - pattern: Pattern.compile(...)
```

Semgrep fails to match its use in `Test2` when presented with the following code:

```
import java.util.regex.Pattern;public String REGEX = "(a+)+$";public class Test2 {   public static void main(String[] args) {        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(REGEX);   }}
```

However, if you change the variable from `public` to `private`, Semgrep returns a match:

```
import java.util.regex.Pattern;private String REGEX = "(a+)+$";public class Test2 {   public static void main(String[] args) {        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(REGEX);   }}
```

Because `REGEX` is public in the first code snippet, Semgrep doesn't propagate its value to other classes on the assumption that it could have mutated. However, in the second example, Semgrep understands that `REGEX` is private and only assigned to once. Therefore, Semgrep assumes it is immutable.

The rule would also work with:

```
...public final String REGEX = "(a+)+$";...
```

## Disable constant propagation[​](#disable-constant-propagation "Direct link to Disable constant propagation")

You can disable constant propagation on a per-rule basis using rule [`options:`](/docs/writing-rules/rule-syntax#options) by setting `constant_propagation: false`.
