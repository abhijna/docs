* [Rule writing](/docs/tags/rule-writing)


Semgrep developed metavariable analysis to support several metavariable inspection techniques that are difficult to express with existing rules, but have "simple" binary classifier behavior. Currently, this syntax supports two analyzers: `redos` and `entropy`.

## ReDoS[​](#redos "Direct link to ReDoS")

```
metavariable-analysis:    analyzer: redos    metavariable: $VARIABLE
```

Poorly constructed regular expressions that exhibit exponential runtime when fed specifically crafted inputs can cause RegEx denial of service. The `redos` analyzer uses known RegEx anti-patterns to determine if the target expression is potentially vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.

## Entropy[​](#entropy "Direct link to Entropy")

```
metavariable-analysis:    analyzer: entropy    metavariable: $VARIABLE
```

Entropy is a common approach for detecting secret strings. Many existing tools utilize a combination of entropy calculations and regular expressions (RegEx) for secret detection. This analyzer returns `true` if a metavariable has high entropy, or randomness, relative to the English language.
