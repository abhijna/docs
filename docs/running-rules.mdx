This document explains how to use local Semgrep rules when scanning your project.

## About rules[​](#about-rules "Direct link to About rules")

Rules define the code patterns Semgrep looks for when scanning your project. When a rule matches code, Semgrep creates a finding. The finding can be related to security, performance, or correctness issues, or it can be used to enforce best practices. Local rules are those that are present in your local environment and accessible to you when running Semgrep using the command line.

## Types of local rules[​](#types-of-local-rules "Direct link to Types of local rules")

There are two types of local rules:

* **Ephemeral rules**: Ephemeral rules are those that you use once. You can pass the rule to Semgrep through the command line as part of your `semgrep scan` command.
* **YAML-defined rules**: YAML-defined rules are [configured in YAML files](/docs/writing-rules/overview) and conform to Semgrep's [rule syntax](/docs/writing-rules/rule-syntax) schema.

## Ephemeral rules[​](#ephemeral-rules "Direct link to Ephemeral rules")

Use the `-e` or `--pattern` flags for ephemeral rules that are used once:

```
semgrep scan -e 'RULE_DEFINITION'
```

For example, to check for the Python `==` operator where the left and right sides are the same, which is often indicative of a bug, run the following command:

```
# ensure that you substitute the placeholder with the path to your project
semgrep scan -e '$X == $X' --lang=py PATH/TO/PROJECT
```

## YAML-defined rules[​](#yaml-defined-rules "Direct link to YAML-defined rules")

### Use the Semgrep default ruleset[​](#use-the-semgrep-default-ruleset "Direct link to Use the Semgrep default ruleset")

To run a Semgrep scan in your local environment with the default Semgrep ruleset, use:

```
semgrep scan --config=auto
```

### Use a Semgrep Registry rule[​](#use-a-semgrep-registry-rule "Direct link to Use a Semgrep Registry rule")

The [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) makes available public rules that you can use to scan your project. Semgrep organizes registry rules into **rulesets**. Rulesets group related rules by features such as programming language, OWASP category, or framework. The Semgrep team curates rulesets, which are updated as new rules are added to the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore).

To run rules from the Semgrep Registry locally:

1. Go to [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore).
2. Select a ruleset and choose a rule.
3. Click **Expand rule > Run locally**.
4. Copy the snippet for **local install**, and add the path to the source code you want to scan in your terminal:
   ```
   semgrep scan --config="RULESET-ID" PATH/TO/SRC
   ```
5. Optional: run the Semgrep Registry rules simultaneously with local rules:
   ```
   semgrep scan --config="RULESET-ID" --config=PATH/TO/MYRULE.YAML PATH/TO/SRC
   ```

<Info>
  Semgrep adds custom prefixes to IDs of local rules using these steps:

  1. Get the relative path from the process's current working directory to the directory containing the rules file.
  2. Replace the directory separators of the relative path with dots.
  3. Remove any characters not allowed in a rule ID from the relative path.
</Info>

### Use a custom rule[​](#use-a-custom-rule "Direct link to Use a custom rule")

<Check>
  See [Write rules](/docs/writing-rules/overview) for more information on defining custom rules.
</Check>

1. Create a `RULE_NAME.yaml` file, and save it in a location accessible to the CLI you're using to run Semgrep. The rule file looks similar to the following sample:
   ```
       rules:    - id: is-comparison    languages:        - python    message: The operator 'is' is for reference equality, not value equality! Use    `==` instead!    pattern: $SOMEVAR is "..."    severity: HIGH
   ```
2. Run the following command to scan with a local rule file:
   ```
   semgrep scan --config PATH/TO/RULE_NAME.YAML
   ```

Semgrep processes rules from hidden directories, such as `dir/.hidden/RULE_NAME.yml`, when you use the `--config` flag.

### Use multiple rules and rulesets simultaneously[​](#use-multiple-rules-and-rulesets-simultaneously "Direct link to Use multiple rules and rulesets simultaneously")

You can use the `--config` flag multiple times to run a scan using multiple rules and rulesets. For example, to scan using Semgrep's Python ruleset and a rule that you defined and saved to `RULE_NAME.YAML`:

```
semgrep scan --config p/python --config PATH/TO/RULE_NAME.YAML
```

Ensure that you update the placeholder values in the sample code snippet accordingly.
