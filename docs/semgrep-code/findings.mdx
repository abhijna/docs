Semgrep Code generates a **finding** when a rule matches a piece of code in your codebase. You can use Semgrep AppSec Platform's [**Code** page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings) to view all of the findings generated by Semgrep Code after it scans your codebase.

## View findings[​](#view-findings "Direct link to View findings")

To view your findings in Semgrep AppSec Platform:

1. Log in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. In the **Navigation bar**, click **[Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings)**.

By default, Semgrep displays your **Priority** findings. Priority findings are defined as findings that:

* Are categorized as **Security** findings. You can identify findings categorized under **Security** using the badge.
* Are flagged with a severity level of **critical** or **high**
* Are flagged with a confidence level of **high**
* Are flagged by Semgrep Assistant as likely being a **true positive** or has *not* been analyzed by Assistant yet

You can switch to the **All** tab at any point to view all findings identified by Semgrep Code. Both the **Priority** findings view and the **All** findings view display high-level information about your findings.

<Note>
  Findings from local scans are differentiated from their remote counterparts through their slugs. Remote repositories are identified as ACCOUNT\_NAME/REPOSITORY\_NAME, while local repositories are identified as local\_scan/REPOSITORY\_NAME.
</Note>

### Custom Priority tab[​](#custom-priority-tab "Direct link to Custom Priority tab")

Semgrep admins can create a custom priority definition to change the findings shown on the **Priority** tab. To do so:

1. Log in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. In the **Navigation bar**, click **[Code](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/findings)**. Ensure that you're viewing the **Priority**.
3. Using the provided filters, set your parameters for priority findings.
4. Click **Save**.
5. You'll see a dialog window asking you to confirm that you want the changes saved for everyone. Click **Save** to proceed.

This change applies to the entire Semgrep organization. You cannot have separate priority definitions for individual users or teams.

## Filter findings[​](#filter-findings "Direct link to Filter findings")

Regardless of whether you use the **Priority** findings view or the **All** findings view, there are multiple grouping and filtering options available to you.

### Time period[​](#time-period "Direct link to Time period")

The time period filters allow you to see which vulnerabilities were opened, fixed, or triaged during a certain period of time. The time period filter is **not** additive; it is a filter operation that precedes other filters on the page. For example, if you select **Last triaged** and select the status **Status Open** filter, no findings appear because, by definition, there are no triaged findings that are also open.

The following filters are available:

* Triage state update action:

  * Opened in
  * Triaged in
  * Fixed in

* Time period:

  * Last day
  * Last 7 days
  * Last 30 days
  * Last 3 months
  * Last 6 months
  * Last year
  * All time

### Project[​](#project "Direct link to Project")

The **Project** filter allows you to search for findings associated with the selected projects.

### Status[​](#status "Direct link to Status")

The **Status** filter allows you to search for findings in the selected statuses. See [Triage status](/docs/semgrep-code/triage-remediation#triage-statuses) for additional information.

### Additional filters[​](#additional-filters "Direct link to Additional filters")

Semgrep offers additional filters that you can use to narrow down your results. The following filters are available:

| Filter                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Severity**                  | Filter by the severity of a finding. Severity is computed based on the values assigned for [Likelihood](/docs/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository#likelihood) and [Impact](/docs/contributing/contributing-to-semgrep-rules-repository#impact) by the rule's author. Possible values:- Low
- Medium
- High
- Critical       |
| **Category**                  | Filter by the type of security issue or vulnerability the rule detects, such as `security`, `correctness`, and `maintainability`. You can select more than one category at a time. See [Finding categories](#finding-categories) for information on how Semgrep categorizes your findings.                                                    |
| **Confidence**                | Filter by the likelihood of the rule to detect true positives. The higher the confidence, the more true positives the rule may detect.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Rule**                      | Filter by rules included in your Policies page. You can select more than one rule or ruleset for filtering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Ruleset**                   | Filter by the ruleset name where rules that match the code belong. More than one rule or ruleset can be selected for filtering.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Pro findings only**         | Filter for findings identified using Semgrep Pro rules. Also includes findings originating from cross-file or cross-function analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Code lifecycle**            | Filter for findings based on whether they are **Production** findings or **Pre-production** findings. **Production** findings are those identified on primary branches, while **Pre-production** findings are those identified on pull request or merge requests.                                                                             |
| **Project tags**              | Filter for findings based on the tags associated with the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Teams**                     | Filter for findings in projects owned by the selected teams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Assistant file risk level** | Filter for findings based on Assistant's assessment of risk level of files based on the type of code identified. High-risk files contain sensitive information, such as authorization and authentication details, while low-risk files may be things like test files. You can further filter by file type, such as **payments** or **tests**. |
| **Assistant autotriage**      | Filter by whether [Assistant autotriage](/docs/semgrep-assistant/overview#auto-triage) has determined the finding to be a **True positive** or **False positive**.                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Finding categories[​](#finding-categories "Direct link to Finding categories")

<Accordion title="Expand to learn about how Semgrep categorizes your findings.">
  A finding can be categorized in two ways:

  1. **Finding categorization based on the issue or code it detects**:

     * Anti-patterns
     * Security vulnerabilities, such as dangerous function usage
     * Business or logic bugs
     * Matches based on your own custom rules, such as organization-specific authentication logic

     Semgrep rules provide a metadata schema to identify these common categories. Semgrep findings include a `message` field that describes the security issue or bug found in matching code. Additionally, findings can provide a `fix` field that fixes the issue by creating a suggestion within your source code management (SCM) tool, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

  2. **Finding categorization based on the validity of the match**:

     * **True positive**: Rules are written to match a certain code pattern. A true positive is a genuine match. The rule is capturing the code as intended.

     * **False positive**: A false positive is a mismatch between the intended purpose of the rule and the code it matched. A finding is generated but does not meet the rule's intended need. Rules with a high false positivity rate are said to be **noisy**.

     * **False negative**: A false negative is a finding that should have been found by a rule, but was not. This can happen for two reasons:

       1. A flaw in the rule's logic. See [Reporting false negatives](/docs/reporting-false-negatives).
       2. A bug within Semgrep itself. See the list of [Semgrep issues](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/issues) to file a bug report.
</Accordion>

## Group and sort findings[​](#group-and-sort-findings "Direct link to Group and sort findings")

By default, Semgrep displays your findings using the **Group by Rule** view. This view shows your findings grouped by the rule Semgrep used to match the code. Your findings are shown sorted **by severity**, but you can opt to sort **by number of findings** for a given rule.

For a given severity, Semgrep further sorts findings as follows:

1. Findings generated by custom rules
2. Findings generated by [Pro rules](/docs/semgrep-code/pro-rules)
3. Issue count in descending order
4. Findings ID in ascending order

To view findings individually, click **Group & sort > No grouping**. Findings are displayed based on the date they were found, with the most recent finding listed at the top.

## Export findings[​](#export-findings "Direct link to Export findings")

You can export findings to a **CSV** file. Semgrep can export up to **10,000 most recent findings**. To export more than 10,000 findings, you must use the [API](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/).

Semgrep exports all findings to the CSV file regardless of the filters you apply on the page.

Export findings by navigating to the product page and clicking the **icon** near the **Group & Sort** filters.

## View details about a specific finding[​](#view-details-about-a-specific-finding "Direct link to View details about a specific finding")

To view in-depth information about a specific finding, select the finding whose details you want to view. Then:

* If the default **Group by Rule** is enabled, click the **Details** icon on the card of the finding.
* If the **No grouping** view is enabled, click the **header hyperlink** on the card of the finding.

The finding's details page displays in-depth information about the finding. It also allows you to perform actions such as updating the finding's status as needed, viewing links to any integrations available, such as associated Jira tickets, and communicating with your team regarding the finding. For example, you can add notes to the finding that anyone with access to the finding can see. See [View findings' details](/docs/semgrep-code/finding-details) for more information.

## How Semgrep displays findings on multiple branches[​](#how-semgrep-displays-findings-on-multiple-branches "Direct link to How Semgrep displays findings on multiple branches")

A **single** finding may appear in several branches. These appearances are called **instances** of a finding. Several instances of the same finding may differ in which line of code (LOC) they are on or in their triage state. For example, on `production` the finding may be on line 20, but the same finding was moved further to line 26 in `feature-branch-a`.

Semgrep automatically recognizes that they are fundamentally the same finding and deduplicates these instances so that you do not get an inflated count of findings per ref that the finding is present in.

By default, the Code page displays findings from the [primary branches](/docs/deployment/primary-branch) of all repositories (projects), arranged by most recent scan. You are viewing the **primary branch's instance** of that finding, so you may see variations in LOC or triage state when comparing the finding across branches.

When filtering by primary branch and triage status, the filters are applied based on the **triage status of the finding on the primary branch**. This means that on some feature branches, the instance may already be **Fixed**, but on the primary branch, the finding is still **Open**. The finding status on the primary branch is updated when the PR or MR is merged and Semgrep has scanned the code.

<Check>
  * If you do not see any findings, or there are zero findings after a scan has concluded, check the **Projects** page to view the findings count, if any, and to set a [primary branch](/docs/deployment/primary-branch), if it is not already set.
  * The total count of findings in the **Projects** page is based on the **primary branch**.
