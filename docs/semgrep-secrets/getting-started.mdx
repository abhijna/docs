* [Semgrep Secrets](/docs/tags/semgrep-secrets)


Semgrep Secrets allows you to detect and triage leaked secrets and credentials and save time by prioritizing which secrets to rotate based on whether they're active and in use.

This document guides you through:

1. Enabling Semgrep Secrets and scanning your repository
2. Configuring your ignore files
3. Upgrading your Semgrep Code rules to Semgrep Secrets rules

## Language and environment support[​](#language-and-environment-support "Direct link to Language and environment support")

Semgrep Secrets can scan repositories using **any programming language** and supports the posting of pull request (PR) and merge request (MR) comments to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## Enable Semgrep Secrets[​](#enable-semgrep-secrets "Direct link to Enable Semgrep Secrets")

<Info>
  You have completed a [Semgrep core deployment](/docs/deployment/core-deployment).
</Info>

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login).
2. Go to **Settings > General > Secrets**.
3. Click the **Secrets scans** toggle to enable Semgrep Secrets.

## Scan your repository[​](#scan-your-repository "Direct link to Scan your repository")

Once you've enabled Secrets for your organization, all Semgrep scans include secret scanning. You can:

* Manually trigger a full scan of your repository through your CI provider
* Start a scan from the CLI (Semgrep recommends that you run CLI scans only on feature branches, not main branches)
* Wait for your scheduled Semgrep full scan
* Open a pull request or merge request and wait for Semgrep to scan the branch automatically

## Configure files to ignore[​](#configure-files-to-ignore "Direct link to Configure files to ignore")

Semgrep Secrets scans all files, even those specified in a local `.semgrepignore` file, since secrets can often be found in files that aren't relevant for code scanning. To specify files that Semgrep Secrets should ignore:

1. Sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login?return_path=/manage/projects).
2. From the **Navigation bar**, select **[Projects](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/projects)**.
3. Find your project, then click **Details**.
4. Go to **Settings > Path ignores**.
5. Enter files and folders to ignore in the **Path Ignores** for Secrets box.
6. Click **Save changes**.

## Upgrade your rules[​](#upgrade-your-rules "Direct link to Upgrade your rules")

If you're using Semgrep Code rules to identify leaked credentials, you'll see prompts in Semgrep AppSec Platform indicating that there's an improved version that uses Semgrep Secrets' feature set, primarily its validators, which can validate whether the detected credential is active, and improvements in detecting and hiding false positives.

You can see individual findings for which there is a Semgrep Secrets rule upgrade in Semgrep AppSec Platform's **Findings** page. The findings are tagged with a label that says `Secrets version available! Click to see rule(s)`.

To see the rules you're using for which there is a Secrets rule upgrade in Semgrep AppSec Platform:

1. Sign in to Semgrep AppSec Platform.
2. Go to **Rules & Policies > Policies > Code**.
3. Under **Available rule upgrades**, select **Secrets**.
