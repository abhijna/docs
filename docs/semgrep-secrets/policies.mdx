To access the policies page for Semgrep Secrets, sign in to [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login) and navigate to **Rules & policies > Policies > Secrets**.

## Validation state policies[​](#validation-state-policies "Direct link to Validation state policies")

Validation state policies allow you to define the rules Semgrep Secrets uses to scan your code, how to handle invalid findings, including those that have been revoked or were never functional, and how to handle validation errors when attempting to determine if a secret is a legitimate credential that can be used to access a resource.

Findings in different validation states may also have different severities, based on the risk associated with valid credentials as compared with invalid credentials. See [Secrets findings: severity](/docs/semgrep-secrets/findings#severity) for more detail on this behavior.

### Global rule behavior[​](#global-rule-behavior "Direct link to Global rule behavior")

The **Global rule behavior** tab allows you to view and manage the rules Semgrep Secrets uses for scanning. This page consists of the following elements:

* The **Filters** pane displays the filters you can use to select and perform operations on rules in bulk. See [Filters](#filters) for more information.
* The **Rules** pane displays the rules that Semgrep scans use to detect leaked secrets and allows you to edit their assigned rule modes. You can make these edits on individual rules or through the bulk editing of many rules. You can also use the **Search for rule names or ids** box. See [Rules list](#rules-list) for more information.

#### Filters[​](#filters "Direct link to Filters")

The **Filters** pane displays the filters you can use to select and perform operations on rules in bulk.

#### Rule modes[​](#rule-modes "Direct link to Rule modes")

Semgrep Secrets provides three rule modes. These can be used to trigger **workflow options** whenever Semgrep Secrets identifies a finding based on the rule.

| Rule mode | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monitor   | Rules in **Monitor mode** display findings only in:- Semgrep AppSec Platform
- **For Semgrep Code and Supply Chain**: User-defined notificationsSet rules to this mode to evaluate their true positive rate and other criteria you may have. By keeping rules in Monitor, developers do not receive potentially noisy findings in their PRs or MRs.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Comment   | Rules in **Comment mode** display findings in:- Developers' PRs or MRs
- Semgrep AppSec Platform
- **For Semgrep Code and Supply Chain**: User-defined notificationsSet rules that have met your performance criteria to this mode when you are ready to display findings to developers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Block     | Rules in **Block mode** cause the scan job to fail with an exit code of `1` if Semgrep Secrets detects a finding from these rules. You can use this result to enforce a block on the PR or MR. For example, GitHub users can enable branch protection and set the PR to fail if the Semgrep step fails. These rules display findings in:- Developers' PRs or MRs
- Semgrep AppSec Platform
- **For Semgrep Code and Supply Chain**: User-defined notificationsThese are typically high-confidence, high-severity rules. |

#### Manage rules[​](#manage-rules "Direct link to Manage rules")

##### Turn off rules[​](#turn-off-rules "Direct link to Turn off rules")

1. In Semgrep AppSec Platform, go to **Rules & policies > Policies > Secrets**.

2. Select either:

   * The top **Number Matching Rules** checkbox to select all rules.
   * Individual checkboxes next to rules.

3. Click **Change modes(Number)**, then click **Disabled**.

You can also select individual rules under the **Mode** column and turn them off individually.

##### Add custom rules[​](#add-custom-rules "Direct link to Add custom rules")

To add custom rules, use the Semgrep Editor. See [Semgrep Secrets rule structure and sample](/docs/semgrep-secrets/rules).

### Invalid findings[​](#invalid-findings "Direct link to Invalid findings")

You can define how Semgrep handles findings that it categorizes as invalid. Invalid findings include secrets that, during validation, were identified as revoked or were never functional.

When Semgrep identifies an invalid finding, you can choose to view the finding in Semgrep AppSec Platform, have Semgrep leave a comment in the pull request or merge request, or have the Semgrep scan fail with an exit code of `1`.

See [Rule modes](#rule-modes) for more information on the modes available.

### Validation errors[​](#validation-errors "Direct link to Validation errors")

You can define how Semgrep handles validation errors that occur when there are difficulties reaching the secrets provider or when Semgrep receives an unexpected response from the API.

When Semgrep encounters a validation error, you can choose to view the associated finding in Semgrep AppSec Platform, have Semgrep leave a comment in the pull request or merge request, or have the Semgrep scan fail with an exit code of `1`.

See [Rule modes](#rule-modes) for more information on the modes available.

## Slack notification policies[​](#slack-notification-policies "Direct link to Slack notification policies")

If you are an **admin** for your Semgrep organization, you can view, create, edit, or delete Slack notification policies. These policies allow you to notify developers of Secrets findings on Slack while managing noise and ensuring that developers are only notified based on the conditions you set. You can configure the following:

* **Scope**: These are the projects (repositories) that are affected by the policy.
* **Conditions**: The conditions under which **actions** are performed. These conditions are typically attributes of a finding, such as severity or validation.
* **Actions**: Actions that are performed on the defined scope when conditions are met.

You can create as many policies as necessary.

<Note>
  This feature requires either the:

  * `semgrep:latest` Docker image
  * Semgrep CLI version 1.101.0 and later
</Note>

### Create a policy[​](#create-a-policy "Direct link to Create a policy")

1. In Semgrep AppSec Platform, go to **Rules & policies > Policies > Secrets**.

2. Click **Create policy**.

3. Provide a **Policy name**.

4. Define the **Scope** of the policy:

   1. Click the drop-down box to select between **All Projects**, **Project**, or **Project tag**.
   2. If you select **Project** or **Project tag**, a second drop-down box appears. Choose the **projects** or **project tags** to finish defining the scope.

5. Define the conditions of the policy. See [Policy conditions](#policy-conditions) for more information. You can create more than one condition by clicking **Add condition**.

   * For each condition, you can select multiple values by clicking on the **plus sign ()** on the same row. The policy is applied when **any** of those values are met (`OR`).
   * Each additional condition is additive. The policy is applied when **all** conditions are met (`AND`).

6. Define the actions of the policy, and select which channels should receive notifications when the policy is triggered. This list is populated by the channels you have subscribed to. To change this list, follow the steps listed in [Receive Slack notifications](/docs/semgrep-appsec-platform/slack-notifications#secrets).

7. Click **Create**.

8. Enable the policy by clicking the **toggle** to enable a policy. This applies the policy to future scans.

#### Policy scopes[​](#policy-scopes "Direct link to Policy scopes")

A policy's scope can consist of tags or projects, but not both. If you need to create a policy with both tags and projects, you must make another policy.

If a project or project tag that's included in a policy scope gets deleted, it is **removed from the policy scope**. If all projects or all project tags are deleted for a given policy, you must edit the policy for it to be applied to a valid scope.

#### Policy conditions[​](#policy-conditions "Direct link to Policy conditions")

The following table lists available conditions and their values:

| Condition                                                     | Values                                                                                                                                       |

## Block a pull request or merge request through rule modes[​](#block-a-pull-request-or-merge-request-through-rule-modes "Direct link to Block a pull request or merge request through rule modes")

Semgrep enables you to set a **workflow action** based on the presence of a finding. Workflow actions include:

* Failing a CI job. Semgrep returns exit code `1`, and you can use this result to set up additional checks to enforce a block on a pull request (PR) or merge request (MR).
* Leaving a [PR or MR comment](/docs/category/pr-or-mr-comments).
* [Notifying select channels](/docs/semgrep-appsec-platform/notifications), such as private Slack channels or webhooks.

You can trigger these actions based on the [rule mode](#rule-modes) set for the rule.
