To resolve confusion within security and developer communities when trying to choose between Semgrep and Opengrep, this page highlights some of the key distinctions to help with decision-making.

## What is Semgrep Community Edition?[​](#what-is-semgrep-community-edition "Direct link to What is Semgrep Community Edition?")

[Semgrep Community Edition](https://semgrep.dev/products/community-edition) (CE) is the collective name for the [open source Semgrep engine](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep), previously known as Semgrep OSS, and the collection of rules published and maintained by the Semgrep community and Semgrep, Inc.

## What is Opengrep?[​](#what-is-opengrep "Direct link to What is Opengrep?")

Opengrep is a fork of Semgrep CE.

## How are Semgrep and Opengrep licenses different?[​](#how-are-semgrep-and-opengrep-licenses-different "Direct link to How are Semgrep and Opengrep licenses different?")

* The Semgrep Community Edition engine is [licensed under LGPL 2.1](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep/blob/develop/LICENSE).
* The Opengrep engine is [licensed under LGPL 2.1](https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep/blob/main/LICENSE).

The LGPL 2.1 license is an open source license that means any copies of the Semgrep or Opengrep engine must include a copy of the full license text and the original copyright notice and must make available the source code when a derivative work is distributed. Any such derivative works must be licensed under the same or later version of the LGPL.

## Is Semgrep CE open source?[​](#is-semgrep-ce-open-source "Direct link to Is Semgrep CE open source?")

Yes, Semgrep CE is open source. This license for the engine has remained unchanged since Semgrep, Inc. began development in early 2020.

Semgrep maintains a collection of rules written by the community and Semgrep, Inc., and they are licensed under the [Semgrep Rules License](https://semgrep.dev/legal/rules-license/). This license limits their use to internal, non-competing, and non-SaaS contexts, and explicitly limits certain commercial usage. This applies to all rules authored by Semgrep and those contributed to our public repositories.

## What changed with Semgrep’s licensing in December 2024?[​](#what-changed-with-semgreps-licensing-in-december-2024 "Direct link to What changed with Semgrep’s licensing in December 2024?")

The license for Semgrep's CE engine remains unchanged: LGPL 2.1.

It was shared in [Important updates to Semgrep OSS](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2024/important-updates-to-semgrep-oss/) that licensing for Semgrep-maintained rules would change from Commons Clause with LGPL 2.1 to the Semgrep Rules License. This change limits certain commercial usage of the rules authored by Semgrep and contributed to our public repositories.

## Are Semgrep and Opengrep actively maintained projects?[​](#are-semgrep-and-opengrep-actively-maintained-projects "Direct link to Are Semgrep and Opengrep actively maintained projects?")

Yes, both projects are actively adding new features and bug fixes.

## How do the command-line interfaces differ between Opengrep and Semgrep?[​](#how-do-the-command-line-interfaces-differ-between-opengrep-and-semgrep "Direct link to How do the command-line interfaces differ between Opengrep and Semgrep?")

The command-line interfaces (CLI) for both projects have similar command usage.

Individual arguments to these commands may have diverged over time.

## Does Semgrep CE support the same features as Opengrep?[​](#does-semgrep-ce-support-the-same-features-as-opengrep "Direct link to Does Semgrep CE support the same features as Opengrep?")

In many cases, the answer is yes.

Semgrep has a large community of users, including major enterprises and service providers that depend on reliability from Semgrep CE. When introducing new features, it is important to see benchmarks that give confidence that regressions or a degradation of performance can be avoided when rolling out new capabilities.

Please [contact Semgrep](/docs/support) if there is a feature missing or if you have any questions.

## Does Semgrep CE support Windows?[​](#does-semgrep-ce-support-windows "Direct link to Does Semgrep CE support Windows?")

Yes, Semgrep can be used natively cross-platform, including Windows. Previously, it was necessary to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or run Semgrep inside a container or VM. That is no longer the case. The Semgrep command-line interface (CLI) can run directly from a Windows prompt or PowerShell environment. Semgrep CE can also be used with plugins for VS Code, IntelliJ, or Cursor.

See [Five considerations when building cross-platform tools for Windows and macOS](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/five-considerations-when-building-cross-platform-tools-for-windows-and-macos) for more information about Windows support.

## Does Semgrep CE support multicore?[​](#does-semgrep-ce-support-multicore "Direct link to Does Semgrep CE support multicore?")

Yes, the Semgrep CE engine is implemented with **Multicore OCaml**, which supports shared-memory parallel processing through the mechanism known as multicore. This allows the Semgrep engine to leverage multiple threads with shared memory in order to more efficiently use processing resources.

See [Boosting security scan performance for monorepos with multicore parallel processing](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/boosting-security-scan-performance-for-monorepos-with-multicore-parallel-processing/) for additional information.

## Is Semgrep CE or Opengrep faster?[​](#is-semgrep-ce-or-opengrep-faster "Direct link to Is Semgrep CE or Opengrep faster?")

Performance and speed claims rely heavily upon a number of factors and often come with trade-offs. You may be able to optimize one particular use case at the expense of performance in another. Semgrep's solutions and support teams can help with evaluation and a proof of value for your specific use cases.

See [Benchmarking Semgrep Community Edition performance improvements](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/benchmarking-semgrep-performance-improvements/) for more about how Semgrep CE thinks about performance.

## What is the difference between Semgrep CE and Semgrep Pro?[​](#what-is-the-difference-between-semgrep-ce-and-semgrep-pro "Direct link to What is the difference between Semgrep CE and Semgrep Pro?")

Semgrep CE is the open source version of the [Semgrep Pro](https://semgrep.dev/products/pro-engine) engine.

Visit [Pricing](https://semgrep.dev/pricing) for a comparison of various features.

### Does Semgrep support interfile taint analysis?[​](#does-semgrep-support-interfile-taint-analysis "Direct link to Does Semgrep support interfile taint analysis?")

Semgrep Community Edition does not support inter-file taint analysis, since this is a feature of Semgrep Pro. This includes all the many variations of data flow across supported languages and environments, including class inheritance, nested functions, type inference, constant propagation, typed metavariables, alias variables, loop mutations, and much more.
