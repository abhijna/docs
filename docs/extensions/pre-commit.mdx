The [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) can run `semgrep` when you commit changes. This is helpful in preventing secrets and security issues from leaking into your Git history.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

[The `pre-commit` framework](https://pre-commit.com).

## `pre-commit` with Semgrep Community Edition (no login)[​](#pre-commit-with-semgrep-community-edition-no-login "Direct link to pre-commit-with-semgrep-community-edition-no-login")

Use these instructions to run `pre-commit` without logging in. You can still use custom rules or rules from the Semgrep Registry.

Add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```
repos:- repo: https://github.com/semgrep/pre-commit  rev: 'v1.152.0'  hooks:    - id: semgrep      entry: semgrep      # Replace <SEMGREP_RULESET_URL> with your custom rule source      # or see https://semgrep.dev/explore to select a ruleset and copy its URL      args: ['--config', '<SEMGREP_RULESET_URL>', '--error', '--skip-unknown-extensions']
```

## `pre-commit` with your Semgrep AppSec Platform configuration[​](#pre-commit-with-your-semgrep-appsec-platform-configuration "Direct link to pre-commit-with-your-semgrep-appsec-platform-configuration")

You can also run custom rules and rulesets from Semgrep AppSec Platform, similar to running `semgrep ci`.

Ensure that you are logged in:

1. Log in to your Semgrep account. Running this command launches a browser window, but you can also use the link that's returned in the CLI to proceed:

   ```
   semgrep login
   ```

2. In the **Semgrep CLI login**, click **Activate** to proceed.

Add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```
repos:- repo: https://github.com/semgrep/pre-commit  rev: 'v1.152.0'  hooks:    - id:  semgrep-ci
```

For guidance on customizing Semgrep's behavior in pre-commit, see [Customize Semgrep in pre-commit](/docs/kb/integrations/customize-semgrep-precommit).
