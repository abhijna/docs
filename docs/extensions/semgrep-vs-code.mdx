* [Extensions](/docs/tags/extensions)


[Semgrep's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Semgrep.semgrep) allows you to scan lines when you open and change files in your workspace. It offers:

* Automatic scans whenever you open a file
* Inline results and problem highlighting, as well as quick links to the definitions of the rules underlying the findings
* Autofix, which allows you to apply Semgrep's suggested resolution for the findings

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* See [Supported Languages](/docs/supported-languages) to verify that the extension supports your project.
* Windows users must use Semgrep VS Code extension v1.6.2 or later.

## Quickstart[​](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")

1. [Install the Semgrep extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-an-extension). If you're unfamiliar with installing VS Code extensions, see the Extension Marketplace's article [Install an Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-an-extension).
2. Use `Ctrl+⇧Shift+P` or `⌘Command+⇧Shift+P` (macOS) to launch the Command Palette, and run the following to sign in to Semgrep AppSec Platform:
   ```
   Semgrep: Sign in
   ```
   You can use the extension without signing in, but doing so enables better results since you benefit from [Semgrep Code](/docs/semgrep-code/overview) and its [Pro rules](/docs/semgrep-code/pro-rules).
3. Launch the Command Palette using `Ctrl+⇧Shift+P` or `⌘Command+⇧Shift+P` (macOS), and scan your files by running:
   ```
   Semgrep: Scan all files in workspace
   ```
4. To see detailed vulnerability information, hover over the code underlined in yellow. You can also see the findings identified by Semgrep using `⇧Shift+Ctrl+M` or `⌘Command+⇧Shift+M` (macOS) and opening the **Problems** tab.

## Commands[​](#commands "Direct link to Commands")

Run Semgrep extension commands through the [Visual Studio Code Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette). You can access the Command Palette using `Ctrl+⇧Shift+P` or `⌘Command+⇧Shift+P` (macOS). The following list includes all available Semgrep extension commands:

* `Semgrep: Scan all files in a workspace`: Scan all files in the current workspace.
* `Semgrep Search: Clear`: Clear pattern searches from the Primary Side Bar's Semgrep Search view.
* `Semgrep Search: Focus on Search Results View`: Bring the Primary Side Bar's Semgrep Search view into focus
* `Semgrep Restart Language Server`: Restart the language server
* `Semgrep: Scan changed files in a workspace`: Scan files that have been changed since the last commit in your current workspace.
* `Semgrep: Search by pattern`: Search for patterns in code using Semgrep pattern syntax. For more information, see [Pattern syntax](/docs/writing-rules/pattern-syntax) documentation.
* `Semgrep: Show Generic AST`: Show generic AST in a new window
* `Semgrep: Show named Generic AST`: Show named AST in a new window
* `Semgrep: Sign in`: Sign in or log in to the Semgrep AppSec Platform (this command opens a new window in your browser). When you sign in, you can automatically scan with Semgrep [Pro rules](/docs/semgrep-code/pro-rules) and add additional rules to the [Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies) in Semgrep Code. If you are logged in with the command-line interface using `semgrep login`, you are also already signed in with the Visual Studio Code Semgrep extension. Alternatively, you can log in through your command-line interface by running `semgrep login`.
* `Semgrep: Sign out`: Log out from Semgrep AppSec Platform. Alternatively, you can sign out through your command-line interface by running `semgrep logout`.
* `Semgrep: Update rules`: For logged-in users. If the rules in the [Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies) or rules included through the **Semgrep › Scan: Configuration** configuration option have been changed, this command loads the new configuration of your rules for your following scan.

Tip: You can click the Semgrep icon in the Visual Studio Code to access all available commands quickly.

## Additional extension features[​](#additional-extension-features "Direct link to Additional extension features")

Use auto-fix to apply code change suggestions from Semgrep to remediate the security issue.

Add and update new rules to expand Semgrep extension's capabilities.

[](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-vscode/assets/626337/fed6b6ec-e0b5-495b-a488-4f3c805dd58b)

Fine-tune and customize the rules Semgrep uses to improve your scan results:

1. Go to [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore). Ensure that you are signed in.
2. Explore the Semgrep Registry, select a rule, and then click **Add to Policy**. You can view and manage your rules in [Policies](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/policies).
3. Rescan your code. Use `Ctrl+⇧Shift+P` or `⌘Command+⇧Shift+P` (macOS) to launch the Command Palette, then run `Semgrep: Update rules`.

## Configure the extension[​](#configure-the-extension "Direct link to Configure the extension")

To configure the Semgrep extension, open its **Extension Settings** page:

1. Use `⇧Shift+Ctrl+X` or `⇧Shift+⌘Command+X` (macOS) to open the **Extensions** view.
2. Select **Semgrep**.
3. Click the **gear** and select **Extension Settings**.

### Configuration options[​](#configuration-options "Direct link to Configuration options")

* **Semgrep › Do Hover**: Enable AST node views when hovering over a finding.
* **Semgrep › Path**: Set the path to the Semgrep executable.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Configuration**: Specify rules or rulesets you want Semgrep to use to scan your code. Each item can be a YAML configuration file, a URL of a configuration file, or a directory of YAML files. Use `auto` to automatically obtain rules tailored to your project. Semgrep uses your project URL to log into the Semgrep Registry. See [Running rules](/docs/running-rules) for more information. Run `Semgrep: Update rules` using the Visual Studio Code Command Palette to update the rules configuration for your following scan whenever you change the rule configuration.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Exclude**: List files and directories that Semgrep should ignore when scanning.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Include**: List files and directories scanned by Semgrep. This option globally overrides the workspace setting. As a result, Semgrep scans all included paths.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Jobs**: Specify how many parallel jobs can run simultaneously. The default number of parallel jobs is one.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Max Memory**: Sets the maximum memory in MB to use.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Max Target Bytes**: Sets the maximum size of the target in bytes to scan.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Only Git Dirty**: Allow Semgrep to scan your code whenever you open a new file and display the findings for lines that have changed since the last commit. On by default.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Pro\_intrafile**: Enable intrafile scanning using the Pro Engine.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Timeout**: Set the maximum run time in seconds before Semgrep times out and stops scanning your code. The default value is 30.
* **Semgrep › Scan: Timeout Threshold**: Set the maximum number of rules that can timeout on a file before the file is skipped. If set to 0, there will be no limit. Defaults to 3.
* **Semgrep > Trace: Server**: This option is useful for debugging. The **messages** option displays communication of the Semgrep Visual Studio Code extension with the LSP server. The default option is **verbose**.

### Experimental configuration options[​](#experimental-configuration-options "Direct link to Experimental configuration options")

The following experimental features should only be used upon recommendation by Semgrep:

* **Semgrep > Ignore CLI Version**: Ignore the CLI Version and enable all extension features.

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

Semgrep's VS Code extension supports the use of Pro rules and cross-file analysis. Other IDE scans use Semgrep Community Edition (CE) for its speed, and these scans are limited to single-file analysis. As a result, you may encounter a higher rate of false positives.

## License[​](#license "Direct link to License")

The Semgrep VS Code extension is licensed under the LGPL 2.1 license.
