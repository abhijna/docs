* [Extensions](/docs/tags/extensions)


[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) swiftly scans code and package dependencies for known issues, software vulnerabilities, and detected secrets. Run Semgrep in your developer environment with the IntelliJ extension to catch code issues as you type. By default, the Semgrep IntelliJ extension scans code whenever you change or open files.

<Info>
  Semgrep's IntelliJ extension for Windows users is currently in beta.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

The Semgrep IntelliJ extension communicates with Semgrep command-line interface (CLI) to run scans. Install Semgrep CLI before you can use the extension. To install Semgrep CLI:

```
# For macOS$ brew install semgrep# For Ubuntu/Windows/Linux/macOS$ python3 -m pip install semgrep
```

## Quickstart[​](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")

1. Install the Semgrep extension:

   * Visit [Semgrep's page on the JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22622-semgrep).
   * In IntelliJ: **Settings/Preferences > Plugins > Marketplace > Search for `semgrep-intellij` > Install**. You may need to restart IntelliJ for the Semgrep extension to be installed.

2. Sign in: Press `Ctrl+⇧Shift+A` (Windows) or `⌘Command+⇧Shift+A` (macOS) and sign in to Semgrep AppSec Platform by selecting the following command:

   ```
   Sign in with Semgrep
   ```

3. Test the extension by pressing `Ctrl+⇧Shift+A` (Windows) or `⌘Command+⇧Shift+A` (macOS) and run the following command:

<Info>
  Semgrep's IntelliJ extensions are currently in beta. Currently, the IntelliJ extension only supports Semgrep Community Edition (CE) - it doesn't support Semgrep Supply Chain, Secrets, Pro rules, or Pro Engine. Please join the [Semgrep community Slack workspace](https://go.semgrep.dev/slack) and let the Semgrep team know if you encounter any issues.

## Supported Jet Brains products[​](#supported-jet-brains-products "Direct link to Supported Jet Brains products")

Semgrep's IDE extension is available in many Jet Brains products:

* AppCode
* Aqua
* CLion
* DataSpell
* DataGrip
* GoLand
* IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
* PhpStorm
* PyCharm Professional
* Rider
* RubyMine
* RustRover
* WebStorm

<Warning>
  IntelliJ extension does not support:

  * IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.

  Semgrep does not offer an IDE integration with IntelliJ Community Edition because [this version lacks support for the Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/language-server-protocol.html#supported-ides), which is essential for enabling Semgrep’s code scanning features. IntelliJ Ultimate, which includes LSP support, is required to use Semgrep's IDE integration.
</Warning>

## Commands[​](#commands "Direct link to Commands")

Run Semgrep extension commands through the IntelliJ Command Palette. You can access the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+⇧Shift+A` (Windows) or `⌘Command+⇧Shift+A` (macOS) on your keyboard.

* `Sign in with Semgrep`: Sign up or log in to the Semgrep AppSec Platform (this command opens a new window in your browser). Alternatively, you can log in through your command-line interface by running `semgrep login`.
* `Sign out of Semgrep`: Log out of Semgrep AppSec Platform. If you are logged out, you lose access to Semgrep Supply Chain and Semgrep Secrets. Alternatively, you can sign out through your command-line interface by running `semgrep logout`.
* `Scan workspace with Semgrep`: Scan files that have been changed since the last commit in your current workspace.
* `Scan workspace with Semgrep (Including Unmodified Files)`: Scan all files in the current workspace.

  You can also click the Semgrep icon in the IntelliJ toolbar to quickly access all available commands.

If you need our support, join the [Semgrep community Slack workspace](https://go.semgrep.dev/slack) and tell us about any problems you encountered.

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

Semgrep's VS Code extension supports the use of Pro rules and cross-file analysis. Other IDE scans use Semgrep Community Edition (CE) for its speed, and these scans are limited to single-file analysis. As a result, you may encounter a higher rate of false positives.

## License[​](#license "Direct link to License")

The Semgrep IntelliJ extension is licensed under the LGPL 2.1 license.
