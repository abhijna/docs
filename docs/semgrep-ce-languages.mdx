This document provides information about supported languages for Semgrep Code and Semgrep CE.

## Semgrep Code and CE[​](#semgrep-code-and-ce "Direct link to Semgrep Code and CE")

Semgrep CE is a fast, lightweight program analysis tool that can help you detect bugs in your code. It makes use of Semgrep's LGPL 2.1 open source engine. These languages are supported by the Semgrep community, at best effort.

Semgrep Code is a static application security testing (SAST) solution designed to detect complex security vulnerabilities. It makes use of proprietary Semgrep analyses, such as cross-file (interfile) dataflow analysis and framework specific analyses, in addition to Semgrep CE. This results in a [**higher true positive rate than Semgrep CE**](/docs/semgrep-pro-vs-oss). Semgrep Code provides the highest quality support by the Semgrep team: reported issues are resolved promptly.

Use either tool to scan local code or integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the continuous scanning of your repositories.

## Language maturity definitions[​](#language-maturity-definitions "Direct link to Language maturity definitions")

Semgrep Code languages can be classified into four maturity levels:

* Generally available (GA)
* Beta
* Experimental
* Community supported\*

\*Community supported languages meet the parse rate and syntax requirements of **Experimental** languages. Users can still access community rules or write their own rules.

| **Feature**         | **GA**                                                                                           | **Beta**                                                                                      | **Experimental**                                                                                                      | **Community supported**                                                                                                                                  |
